      <birthName>Paymer, David Charles</birthName>
      <biography>One of modern TV and moviedom&apos;s most sturdy and reliable character actors, David Paymer dreamed of being an actor from early childhood. Although he came from a traditional middle-class Jewish family that urged him to become a doctor or lawyer, Paymer felt more at home in the world of the thespian. At 14, he used a fake I.D. to see The Graduate, which starred a young Dustin Hoffman. He grew up in Oceanside, New York, where his father was in the scrap metal business. His mother, a homemaker, had fled Belgium with her family to escape the Nazis. When his father quit the scrap metal business to pursue music, it inspired young Paymer to give his acting dream a try. His aborted big break came when he was cast in the TV series, St. Elsewhere, as &quot;Dr. Wayne Fiscus&quot; - then promptly dumped and replaced by Howie Mandel. Luckily, his real big break was destined to be on the big screen, as &quot;Ira Shalowitz&quot; in the Billy Crystal vehicle, City Slickers. Crystal was so pleased with Paymer&apos;s work that he wrote the part of &quot;Stan Yankelman&quot;, beleaguered brother of the titular character in the movie, Mr. Saturday Night, especially for Paymer. The part earned Paymer an Oscar nomination in 1993.  &quot;That was like getting my passport stamped&quot;, said Paymer and he was quickly in demand by directors such as Spielberg (&quot;Amistad&quot;), Redford (&quot;Quiz Show&quot;), Oliver Stone (&quot;Nixon&quot;), David Mamet (&quot;State &amp; Main&quot;), Steven Soderbergh (&quot;Ocean&apos;s 13&quot;), and Sam Raimi (&quot;Drag me to Hell&quot;). Chameleon-like in his portrayals, Paymer has since starred in hundreds of roles in film &amp; television, notably &quot;The American President&quot;, &quot;Get Shorty&quot;, &quot;Payback&quot;, &quot;The Hurricane&quot;, &quot;In Good Company&quot;, Francis Ford Coppola&apos;s &quot;Twixt&quot; and Kenneth Branagh&apos;s &quot;Jack Ryan: Shadow One&quot;.  Paymer received Golden Globe nominations for &quot;Mr. Saturday Night&quot; and for HBO&apos;s &quot;Crime of the Century&quot;. Paymer became a hyphenate in 2002, directing the acclaimed comedy short &quot;Candor City Hospital&quot; for Showtime. He has since directed over 60 episodes for broadcast television, including such hits as &quot;Grey&apos;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;The Mentalist&quot;, &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot; &amp; &quot;The Unit&quot;. He is also a producer and director on the CW series &quot;Hart of Dixie&quot;. Paymer resides in Santa Monica, CA with his wife and two daughters.</biography>

      <biography>Skipper Landry was born on Veterans Day, 1971 on Elmendorf Air Force Base in Anchorage, Alaska to Paul &amp; Margarita Landry. Soon after his father&apos;s enlistment was up, his family moved back to Baton Rouge, Louisiana and settled down.  Medical issues kept Skipper from attending most of elementary and middle school, but he eventually was able to attended, and graduate from Calvary Christian School. During his high school years he landed his first job, a cashier at K-mart at the age of 15. In his junior year until well into college, he worked along side of friends such as Jeff, Chris, Zeke and Lyle as a DJ at local night clubs. He attended Louisiana State University for a time where he failed out due to frequenting the student union rather than classes.  Skipper eventually settled down working as a security and fire alarm technician where he worked most of his adult life and still holds an active NICET III Life Safety license.  One constant throughout his life was his need to be creative. Early on it manifested through landscaping lawns in his neighborhood, then through building, modifying, restoring and showcasing cars and motorcycles. At one point in time he bought and restored a 1982 DeLorean DMC12. Most recently his need to be creative has taken the form of acting and cinematography.  At the age of 38, he was introduced to acting by a fluke. Skipper began taking classes in acting in New Orleans and was soon showing up in bit parts in feature films. His has been in featured in major motion pictures, tv series, a few made for tv movies and just recently wrapped on an independent supernatural thriller and is filming his first co-staring SAG role in January 2013.  Moving to acting full time in 2012 has been a major step toward building a creative outlet and entertaining others by telling good stories.</biography>

      <biography>British classical stage and TV actor Tim Pigott-Smith is a familiar face both here and in his native England. A drama major, he graduated from the University of Bristol in 1967 (where he frequently lectures) and made his professional debut two years later with the Bristol Old Vic. Predominantly a stage player in both regional and repertory, he made his Broadway debut in &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; as Dr. Watson in 1974. Over the years, he has appeared opposite England&apos;s theatre royalty including Judi Dench, Helen Mirren, Geraldine James, Margaret Tyzack, and Patrick Stewart. He formed his own theatre company in later years, Compass, and served as its artistic director from 1989-1992. In addition, he has directed several major productions including &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;A Royal Hunt of the Sun.&quot; He has taken several Shakespearean classics to TV, including his Hotspur in &quot;Henry IV, Part I&quot; and Angelo in &quot;Measure for Measure,&quot; and delivered impressive performances in such prestigious mini-series productions as &quot;Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years,&quot; &quot;Fame Is the Spur&quot; and &quot;The Jewel in the Crown.&quot; Lesser known for his body of film work, such movies as Aces High (1976), his film debut, Joseph Andrews (1977), Victory (1981), Clash of the Titans (1981), State of Emergency (1986), Remains of the Day (1993), and Martin Scorcese&apos;s Gangs of New York (2002) have yet given him that necessary breakout role. Tim is a frequent broadcaster who has recorded many audio books and has published the anthology, &quot;Out of India.&quot; He has long been married to actress Pamela Miles and they have one son, Tom, who is a concert solo violinist. He recently scored critical acclaim in &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot; (both London and Broadway), and as Ebenezer Scrooge in &quot;A Christmas Carol.&quot; Most recently he graced the stage with Ms. Mirren in the 4 1/2 hour production of &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra.&quot;</biography>

      <gender>MALE</gender>
      <birthDateAsString>4 June 1936</birthDateAsString>
      <birthName>Dern, Bruce MacLeish</birthName>
      <biography>Bruce Dern had established himself as the movies&apos; premier heavy, playing sociopaths, psychotics and just plain criminals by the time he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for _Coming Home (1978)_ (qv). Some perceptive critics had noted that Dern was a finer actor than his roles generally allowed one to believe, repelled as one was by the neurotic persona that Dern was able to project and that casting directors capitalized on.  &apos;Jack Nicholson (I)&apos; (qv), a close friend, claimed that Dern was the best of the new breed of actors who had been born just before World War II and were coming into their own in the 1970s. Unlike his screen image, Dern had come from a patrician background: his grandfather had been governor of Utah and a secretary of war under &apos;Franklin D. Roosevelt&apos; (qv). When allowed to step out of his on-screen persona to assay the millionaire Tom Buchanan in the 1974 remake of _The Great Gatsby (1974)_ (qv), he acquitted himself quite well.  Some critics said that &quot;Gatsby&quot; would have been better if Dern rather than &apos;Robert Redford (I)&apos; (qv) had played the title role. Others pointed to his fine work as Nicholson&apos;s brother in _The King of Marvin Gardens (1972)_ (qv) to establish a case that he was an underappreciated and underutilized talent. By the time Dern appeared as the cuckolded Marine in &quot;Coming Home,&quot; a consensus had emerged that Dern was a fine actor. He won an Oscar nod for the role, then fell victim to the infamous &quot;Oscar curse&quot; that has claimed other winners, most famously in the case of 1969 Best Supporting Actor winner &apos;Gig Young&apos; (qv), Dern&apos;s co-star in _They Shoot Horses, Don&apos;t They? (1969)_ (qv).  Dern, like Young before him, was determined to break out of supporting roles. Like Young, who had been cast repeatedly as a light comedian in his career, Dern had also become typecast, but as a psycho, surpassing even &apos;Anthony Perkins (I)&apos; (qv) in those types of roles. Dern was determined to break out of the ghetto he had found himself in before &quot;Coming Home.&quot; He failed, and his career suffered.  Up through his Oscar nomination, Dern had starred in 26 films in 11 years since graduating to steady employment in A-pictures with _Waterhole #3 (1967)_ (qv). After the 1979 Oscar nod, he would appear in only a dozen feature films in the next 11 years, not counting TV movies. None of them brought him stardom or much acclaim, and his attempt at becoming a lead man, _Middle Age Crazy (1980)_ (qv), flopped badly (he did received a nomination for Best Performance by a Foreign Actor at the 1981 Genie Awards, the Canadian equivalent of the Oscars, for his work in that picture). It was back to psychos, this time as a lead, in _Tattoo (1981)_ (qv). The movie proved to be another flop, and his reputation was further damaged when he bragged that he had actually performed on-screen sexual intercourse with co-star &apos;Maud Adams&apos; (qv), a boast that Adams heatedly denied. Dern&apos;s star was seriously dimmed.  Although he landed a coveted role in the film adaptation of &apos;Jason Miller (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s Pulitzer Prize-winning play _That Championship Season (1982)_ (qv), the film was a disappointment with critics and at the box office. He turned in a fine performance three years later in the TV movie _Toughlove (1985) (TV)_ (qv), but overall, his career was floundering.  Another psycho role, that of Uncle Bud in _After Dark, My Sweet (1990)_ (qv), started buzz about another possible Best Supporting Oscar nod for him, but the film proved a box-office bust and the nomination never materialized. A predicted career renaissance for Dern faded, just as the careers of his ex-wife, &apos;Diane Ladd&apos; (qv), and their daughter, &apos;Laura Dern&apos; (qv), kicked into high gear.  Since the 1990 high point of the second wave of his career, Dern has stayed steadily employed, but has never again generated much critical acclaim, nor made any inroads towards reclaiming his crown as the cinema&apos;s premier sociopath. A fine actor, who will be remembered most vividly for such psycho/killer roles such as the rustler leader who gunned down &apos;John Wayne (I)&apos; (qv) in _The Cowboys (1972)_ (qv), Dern&apos;s career serves as a cautionary tale for those actors who try to escape the ghetto of typecasting. While nothing restricts an actor&apos;s artistic development as much as typecasting, unless like a Duke Wayne they can turn that type into superstardom, trying to break out of the type can prove to be career suicide.</biography>

      <biography>Jonathan Pryce was born on June 1, 1947, in Holywell, Wales. His father, named Isaac Price, was a coal miner, who died in 1976. His mother, named Margaret Ellen (nee Williams), was a retail cashier. He left the home of his parents at age 16 to attend an art school, where he became interested in drama. At some point he changed the spelling of his last name from Price to Pryce. He studied acting on a scholarship at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. After graduation from RADA, he joined the Liverpool Everyman Theatre and eventually became its Artistic Director.  In the 1970s Pryce established himself on the London stage with appearances in &apos;The Taming of the Shrew&apos;, &apos;Hamlet&apos;, and &apos;Measure for Measure&apos; among other plays. He won the 1977 Tony Award for his Broadway debut in &apos;Comedians&apos;, for which he also earned the 1977 Theatre World Award and the 1977 nomination for Drama Desk Outstanding Actor Award. Pryce earned his second Tony Award 15 years later for the role as &quot;The Engineer&quot;, a half-Vietnamese/half French pimp in &apos;Miss Saigon&apos;. Pryce created the role in the original London production and agreed to reprise the role on Broadway in a transplant of the same production. Despite controversy over his appearance -- the actors union decried the long-standing practice of hiring white actors to play Asian or Eurasian characters, especially given the paucity of roles for Asian characters, and it also objected to the producer&apos;s refusal to even audition any Asian actors -- he gave a brilliant performance.  In 1976 Pryce made his big screen debut in _Voyage of the Damned (1976)_ (qv). But it wasn&apos;t until 1983 that he made a strong impression with his scary performance as a freaky manipulative Mr. Dark in Ray Bradbury&apos;s _Something Wicked This Way Comes (1983)_ (qv). Pryce shot to fame with _Brazil (1985)_ (qv) and his role as Sam Lowry, a technocrat trying to correct an error caused by a bug and himself becomes entangled in psychopathic bureaucracy eventually becoming an enemy of the state. He also filled such strong and authoritative roles, as president Juan Peron opposite Madonna in _Evita (1996)_ (qv), then co-starred opposite Pierce Brosnan as Elliot Carver, the evil megalomaniac media mogul in the 18th Bond film, _Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)_ (qv).  Pryce&apos;s versatility and multifaceted talent rarely had a chance to take him beyond playing freaks and villains in film, an imposed forte which he, however, managed to overcome in his numerous stage performances and in a few film and TV works. He went on playing a range of characters marked with sophistication and depth, such as his subtle and nuanced portrayal of author Lytton Strachey in _Carrington (1995)_ (qv), for which he won the Best Actor Award at Cannes. Pryce also shone in musicals &apos;My Fair Lady&apos; and &apos;Oliver&apos; to name just a few. Pryce made numerous works for television ranging from costume dramas to comedy, and from narrations to singing. In January 2006, he replaced John Lithgow as Lawrence Jameson in the acclaimed musical version of &apos;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&apos;. He appeared as the timid Jamaican Governor Wetherby Swann in _Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)_ (qv), and the sequel _Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&apos;s Chest (2006)_ (qv), and the third installment of the Pirates franchise, _Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&apos;s End (2007)_ (qv).  Jonathan Pryce has been with his partner, actress Kate Fahy, since 1974 when they met at the Everyman Theatre Liverpool Company, though they have never married. They have two sons, Patrick (born 1983) and Gabriel (born 1986), and one daughter, Phoebe (born 1990). Pryce and Fahy also co-starred in the 2004 production of &apos;The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?&apos;. Fahy and Pryce reside with their family in England.</biography>

      <biography>Shae Wilson had just entered her freshman year in high school the day she watched a Charlie&apos;s Angels&apos; episode and her future was set: she was determined to play the fourth angel. The next morning she tracked down the school drama teacher and gave her no choice but to get her in a drama class. Thus began her career as an actor.  It wasn&apos;t Charlie&apos;s Angels that launched her acting career, it was playing the heroine. She beat out over 10,000 actors who came to Las Vegas to compete for Star Trek The Experience roles. For the next seven years she bravely battled aliens as an officer on the Starship Enterprise. Her ability to save the human race was so impressive, it landed her a lead in the sci-fi feature, War of the Planets.  Shae is much more than an alien fighter. She has continued to grow in diversity through study and challenging roles in TV, film, theater, and commercials. For example in Ocean&apos;s 13, she played the soft spoken ticket agent alongside a star studded cast. Her portrayal of an harassed cocktail waitress on America&apos;s Most Wanted was so moving,, it led to the capture of an at-large criminal. She won the hearts of audiences and critics as Toby in the stage production of Niel Simon&apos;s&quot;The Gingerbread Lady.&quot; Her charisma and naturalness in front of the camera have landed her with many commercials.  Her lifelong passion for creating characters and performing spills over into improv. As an understudy with the world-famous Second City Comedy Troupe, her kooky-and convincing--characters kept audiences rolling in the aisles.  Shae compliments her acting as a talented singer and dancer, which makes her a triple treat. She has wowed audiences around the country as Florence Ballard in an ensemble that impersonates the Supremes and placed first in several hip hop dance contests!  Shae gives back by sharing her gift in nonpaying productions. Most recently she played a woman twice her age in &quot;The Party&quot; at a retirement center. During the meet and greet, residents were shocked to learn that she wasn&apos;t one of them.  Shae expresses equally intense passion and dedication in her biggest roles of all-mother, daughter, sister and friend. She is grateful for the love and support of those around her who constantly reminder that no matter how tough the business gets, &quot;Nobody puts baby in a corner.&quot;</biography>

      <birthName>Bonaventura, Anthony Paul</birthName>
      <biography>Born in Chicago and raised in Northwest Indiana, Tony&apos;s childhood was a far cry from the nurturing and stable environment in which all children should be raised. Taken away by DCFS from his biological parents at age 2 due to substance abuse, Tony and his older brother lived with their biological aunt for a short period before being taken away yet again. Tony and his brother were placed in several different foster homes before finally being adopted by Dr. Angelo and Kathy Bonaventura at the age of 9. But, as normal as Tony thought his life was, he still had his ups and downs. Tony&apos;s parents divorced when he was 13. Growing up, Tony found himself getting into trouble at school and with the law. He was kicked out of several different high schools; once at St. John&apos;s Military Academy for escaping in the trunk of a friends car. Tony also attended Valparaiso High School but was kicked out his senior year. During this tough time, Tony was incarcerated and finally got his GED. On November 4th, 1997 Tony&apos;s father, whom he was very close to, died of cancer. Although Tony&apos;s life was characterized by instability, one thing remained constant; he wanted to act. At age 21, Tony became the father to a beautiful baby girl named Michela. It was at this point he knew he had to focus on achieving his goals, and that meant making changes. Tony left Indiana and moved to Chicago when he was 23 hoping to get started on his acting career. Tony enrolled at Columbia College for two years majoring in Film and also took acting classes at the Audition Studio. He worked on several low budget films including The Guys (2004), which premiered at the Music Box at the Chicago Comedy Film Festival and I Was A Mathlete Until I Met Margo Marris (2003), which premiered at the Chicago International Film Festival, Tribeca, Newport Beach, Dances with Films (Santa Monica, CA), and the Sidewalk Moving Film Festival. When Tony wasn&apos;t working on films he did some theater work at Navy Pier, one of Chicago&apos;s biggest tourist attractions. In This Town, Tony plays the role of Jimmy, a young man who has a one night stand with his adolescence alongside his childhood friends.</biography>

      <biography>Teri Lynn Hatcher was born in Palo Alto, California, USA, as the only child of Owen and Esther Hatcher, and grew up in nearby Sunnyvale, California. Her father is a nuclear physicist and her mother is a computer programmer. She spent her childhood dancing and fishing with her father. While at Fremont High School, she was captain of the Featherettes, a dance team that had the look of regular cheerleaders, with the exception of the large headdresses they wore. She was voted &quot;Most Likely to Become a _&quot;Solid Gold&quot; (1980)_ (qv) Dancer&quot; by her graduating class in 1982. Hatcher studied acting at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco while taking a degree course in mathematics and engineering at De Anza College in Cupertino, California. She became a member of the 1984 Gold Rush, the name of the professional cheer leading squad of the American football San Francisco 49ers.  Hatcher went to Hollywood to lend moral support to a friend during a open casting call. She, however, auditioned and won the role of the singing and dancing mermaid for the television series _&quot;The Love Boat&quot; (1977)_ (qv). She went on to play &quot;Penny Parker,&quot; a ditsy but sweet-hearted struggling actress on _&quot;MacGyver&quot; (1985)_ (qv). When that show ended, she auditioned for and won the role of smart and savvy &quot;Lois Lane&quot; on _&quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; (1993)_ (qv), saying that she didn&apos;t want to be stuck with the pretty airhead image she had acquired as &quot;Penny Parker.&quot;  She married actor &apos;Jon Tenney&apos; (qv) in May 1994. She gave birth to daughter &apos;Emerson Tenney&apos; (qv) on November 10, 1997. Later, she signed to play &quot;Sally Bowles&quot; in a road tour of Cabaret. The tour debuted in Los Angeles on March 2, 1999. Her final show was on September 4, 1999. She stayed out of the industry for a little bit before nabbing a role on the darkly comedic soap opera _&quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; (2004)_ (qv), which could have been a huge mistake. The show turned out to be a mega-hit, which skyrocketed Hatcher to the A-list. Her portrayal of a divorced mother, &quot;Susan Mayer,&quot; was consistently named as America&apos;s favorite &quot;Desperate Housewife.&quot; Hatcher won both a Golden Globe for Lead Actress in a Comedy Series and the SAG Award for Female Actor in a Comedy Series before the show&apos;s first season was even over.</biography>

      <biography>Gregory Allen Gabroy grew up in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania and during his formative years attended the prestigious Haverford School. It became apparent early on that Gregory had a gift for public performance, winning several public speaking awards and being featured on stage as an actor as well as singer. During his tenure, he also appeared in several independent films including Ice Scream, The Ten Commitments and the critically acclaimed Ace of Hearts. After graduating with honors, he went on to attend Tulane University. During his time in New Orleans he received instruction from Ashley Nolan and while abroad in Spain went under the tutelage of R. Domenech. Upon his return to America, he was asked to model for a alcohol awareness campaign and offered his voice talent as a public service announcer to WTUL 91.5 FM. Graduating cum laude with a double major in History and Spanish, he left New Orleans just a few months before Hurricane Katrina devastated the city. His return to the Philadelphia area after graduating college allowed him to hone his acting skills by taking several classes with Mike Lemon and participating in several more independent films. After taking stock and with his family&apos;s blessing, Gregory packed two suitcases and bought a one way ticket to Los Angeles. He has never looked back.</biography>

      <birthName>Barkin, Ellen Rona</birthName>
      <biography>Offbeat, unconventionally pretty, and utterly mesmerizing, Ellen Barkin was born in 1954 of Jewish parentage, the daughter of a chemical salesman and hospital administrator. Raised in the South Bronx and Queens, New York area, she wanted to be an actress as early as her teens and was eventually accepted into Manhattan&apos;s High School of the Performing Arts.  Barkin then attended Hunter College and received her degree after double majoring in history and drama. At one point she wanted to teach ancient history, but instead turned her thoughts back to her first love - acting. Barkin then continued her education at New York&apos;s Actor&apos;s Studio. Fearful of the auditioning process, she studied acting for seven years before finally landing her first audition. While continuing her studies, she worked as a waitress at the avant-garde Ocean Club. Performing off-Broadway in such plays &quot;Shout Across the River&quot; (1979), &quot;Extremities&quot; (1983), &quot;Fool for Love&quot; (1984) and &quot;Eden Court&quot; (1985), she was applauded across the board for her first film lead in _Diner (1982)_ (qv) opposite &apos;Mickey Rourke&apos; (qv) and &apos;Daniel Stern (I)&apos; (qv), and pursued sexy tough-cookie status thereafter with such quirky roles in _The Big Easy (1986)_ (qv) starring &apos;Dennis Quaid&apos; (qv) and _Siesta (1987)_ (qv) with Irish actor &apos;Gabriel Byrne&apos; (qv), whom she married in 1987 and separated from in 1993 after producing a son and daughter. She and Byrne divorced in 1999.  With trademark squinting eyes and slightly off-kilter facial features, Barkin continued the fascination of her seamy/steamy girl-from-the-wrong-side-of-the-tracks status most notably opposite &apos;Al Pacino&apos; (qv) in the thriller _Sea of Love (1989)_ (qv). In addition, she was well cast as &apos;Robert De Niro&apos; (qv)&apos;s abused wife in _This Boy&apos;s Life (1993)_ (qv), and portrayed &quot;Calamity Jane&quot; in _Wild Bill (1995)_ (qv) with earnest. Other impressionable offbeat projects included roles in _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998)_ (qv), _Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999)_ (qv) and _Mercy (2000)_ (qv). On TV, she was well-cast in the mini-movie _Clinton and Nadine (1988) (TV)_ (qv) and won an Emmy award for her gripping performance in _Before Women Had Wings (1997) (TV)_ (qv) opposite &apos;Oprah Winfrey&apos; (qv) as another abused wife who, in this case, turns her violent anger on her own daughters.  In 2000, Barkin married billionaire &apos;Ronald O. Perelman&apos; (qv), eleven years her senior and chairman of the Revlon company, and put her career relatively on hold, appearing sporadically in edgy films like _She Hate Me (2004)_ (qv) and _Palindromes (2004)_ (qv). Barkin and Perelman went through an acrimonious divorce in 2006.  Just prior to her divorce in late 2005, Barkin ventured into independent film production with Applehead Pictures, a company she set up with her brother &apos;George Barkin&apos; (qv), who is a scriptwriter and former editor-in-chief of National Lampoon and High Times, and former Independent Film Channel executive &apos;Caroline Kaplan (I)&apos; (qv). In her first major acting appearance since her divorce from Perelman, Barkin co-starred in _Ocean&apos;s Thirteen (2007)_ (qv) with &apos;George Clooney&apos; (qv), &apos;Matt Damon&apos; (qv), &apos;Brad Pitt&apos; (qv) and former co-star Pacino. She followed up Ocean&apos;s with a supporting role in &apos;Antoine Fuqua&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Brooklyn&apos;s Finest (2009)_ (qv), _Happy Tears (2009)_ (qv) with &apos;Parker Posey&apos; (qv) and &apos;Demi Moore&apos; (qv), and _Twelve (2010)_ (qv).  Recently, Barkin has produced features, including _Letters to Juliet (2010)_ (qv) and _Another Happy Day (2011)_ (qv) (she also starred in the latter project). On the small screen, she appeared in an episode of _&quot;Modern Family&quot; (2009)_ (qv) and her new NBC show, _&quot;The New Normal&quot; (2012)_ (qv), got a sneak peek during the Olympics.  She lives with her two teenage children in Manhattan.</biography>

      <biography>William Hudson, an American actor from Chicago, is the son of Michael Hudson, a popular radio disc jockey on Chicago&apos;s number one urban station, WGCI 107.5. William attended St. Ignatius high school on West Roosevelt Rd. and played varsity basketball for the Wolfpack. His love and talent for the game ended him up at The University of Miami with the Hurricanes, however after just one year he decided to focus on entertainment instead.  While on a trip to New York City in the summer of 2007 visiting friends of the family, Hudson found himself in the borough of Brooklyn at the exact same time as the academy award winning director, Ridley Scott was filming the 1970&apos;s based major motion picture, &quot;American Gangster.&quot; Wearing his hair braided in cornrows at the time, Hudson decided to take them out and approach Mr. Scott with his own 70&apos;s style afro and ambition. Seeing the determination in Mr. Hudson&apos;s eyes and the hairstyle befitting of the period piece, Ridley decided to include William in the film as a drug dealer alongside fellow Chicago native and actor, &quot;Common Sense.&quot;  With the successful major motion picture, &quot;American Gangster&quot; under his belt, Mr. Hudson then found himself in Los Angeles, California on an audition for another period piece to be directed by yet another academy award winning director, Quentin Tarantino. The movie was &quot;Django Unchained,&quot; and the role was that of the character named, &quot;Blueberry,&quot; a slave turned killer deep in the woods of Texas in the year 1861. &quot;Django Unchained&quot; went on the be Mr. Tarantino&apos;s highest grossing film to date.  Mr. Hudson still lives in Chicago Illinois.</biography>

      <birthName>Craig, Daniel Wroughton</birthName>
      <biography>Daniel Craig, one of British theatre&apos;s most famous faces who was waiting tables as a struggling teenage actor with the NYT, went on to star as &quot;James Bond&quot; in _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv), _Quantum of Solace (2008)_ (qv) and _Skyfall (2012)_ (qv).  He was born Daniel Wroughton Craig on March 2, 1968, at 41 Liverpool Road, Chester, Cheshire, England. His father, Tim Craig, was a merchant seaman turned steel erector, then became landlord of &quot;Ring O&apos; Bells&quot; pub in Frodsham, Cheshire. His mother, Carol Olivia Craig, was an art teacher. His parents split up in 1972, and young Daniel Craig was raised with his older sister, Lea, in Liverpool, then in Hoylake, Wirral, in the home of his mother. His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of 6, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of &quot;Oliver!&quot;, and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was &apos;Roger Moore (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club.  At the age of 14, Craig played roles in &quot;Oliver&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Cinderella&quot; at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral, UK. He left Hilbre High at 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre&apos;s (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as &quot;Agamemnon&quot; in Shakespeare&apos;s &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;. As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director &apos;Edward Wilson (I)&apos; (qv). He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside &apos;Ewan McGregor&apos; (qv) and &apos;Alistair McGowan&apos; (qv), then later &apos;Damian Lewis (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Joseph Fiennes&apos; (qv), among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of &apos;Colin McCormack (I)&apos; (qv), the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named &apos;Ella Craig&apos; (qv), was born in 1992. Daniel Craig made his film debut in _The Power of One (1992)_ (qv). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial _&quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; (1996)_ (qv). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in _Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)_ (qv) and _Road to Perdition (2002)_ (qv). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in _Layer Cake (2004)_ (qv), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray &quot;James Bond&quot;, in October of 2005, weeks after he finished his work in _Munich (2005)_ (qv), where he co-starred with &apos;Eric Bana&apos; (qv) under the directorship of &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv).  Craig&apos;s reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool &quot;007&quot;. He is the first blonde actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author &apos;Ian Fleming (I)&apos; (qv) in 1964. Four of the past Bond actors: &apos;Sean Connery&apos; (qv), &apos;Roger Moore (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Timothy Dalton&apos; (qv) and &apos;Pierce Brosnan&apos; (qv) have indicated that Craig is a good choice as &quot;Bond&quot;.</biography>

      <biography>Tall, broad shouldered character actor with Texan drawl first appeared in support in several Western vehicles both on TV and the cinema in the mid 1960s. Got himself noticed playing Steve McQueen&apos;s younger brother in _Junior Bonner (1972)_ (qv), and then scored the lead role of Buford Pusser (!) in the unexpected hit _Walking Tall (1973)_ (qv), an allegedly true tale about a Southern sheriff confronting corruption &amp; gangsters with a large wooden club and a mean attitude. Followed it up by playing a sadistic hit man called Molly, in Don Siegel&apos;s bank heist drama _Charley Varrick (1973)_ (qv). Joe Don Baker&apos;s next few films were rather forgettable until he landed the role of police detective Earl Eischied in _To Kill a Cop (1978) (TV)_ (qv)....which led him into reprising the same character in the short lived TV series _&quot;Eischied&quot; (1979)_ (qv). Since then he has proved he is also quite adept at taking on comedy roles, as well as picking up plenty of work playing lawmen, military men, politicians etc. Keep your eye open for him as a nosy police chief in _Fletch (1985)_ (qv), a meglomanical general in _The Living Daylights (1987)_ (qv), as a redneck father in _Mars Attacks! (1996)_ (qv), and as intelligence operative Jack Wade in the 007 films _Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)_ (qv) and _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv).</biography>

      <biography>A classically-trained acting veteran is David Calder. He was born August 1, 1946 in Portsmouth, England and possesses an impressive resume of accomplished work in acting since 1970. Naturally exuding wisdom and talent, David Calder often appears as just that: wise, scholarly old gentleman in almost any film or television appearance he makes. Undoubtedly an accomplished and easily-recognizable face to British audiences, however David perhaps is better known to American audiences with his appearances in high profile movies such as the James Bond spy-action film The World Is Not Enough (1999) as Sir Robert King, the on-screen father of Sophie Marceau; and then in the Mummy trilogy subtitled Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008).</biography>

      <biography>Angie Dickinson was born in Kulm, North Dakota, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. L. H. Brown. Mr. Brown was the publisher of The Kulm Messenger. The family left North Dakota in 1942 when Angie was 11 years old, moving to Burbank, California. In December 1946, when she was a senior at Bellamarine Jefferson High School in Burbank, she won the Sixth Annual Bill of Rights Contest. Two years later, her sister Janet did likewise. Being the daughter of a printer, Angie at first had visions of becoming a writer, but gave this up after winning her first beauty contest. After finishing college, she worked as a secretary in a Burbank airplane parts factory for 3-1/2 years. In 1953, she entered the local Miss America contest one day before the deadline and took second place. In August of the same year, she was one of five winners in a beauty contest sponsored by NBC and appeared in several television variety shows. She got her first bit part in a Warner Brothers film in 1954 and gained fame in the television series _&quot;The Millionaire&quot; (1955)_ (qv) and got her first good film role opposite &apos;John Wayne (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Dean Martin (I)&apos; (qv) in _Rio Bravo (1959)_ (qv). Her success then spiraled until she became one of the nation&apos;s top movie stars.</biography>

      <biography>Simona Roman, born Brhlikova, hails from former Czechoslovakia with roots spanning all the way to Mongolia. She was bitten by the entertainment-bug in her early childhood and at the young age starred in several stage and musical productions.  Known not only for her striking aesthetic appeal - Simona also speaks 7 languages.  Leaving the family nest at 17 Simona embarked on the bold adventure across Northern America and Africa for some &apos;fun&apos; and life experience.

      <biography>An actor on television since the early 1990s, Michael Harney frequently essayed tough men with deeply complicated interior lives in such acclaimed series as &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; (ABC 1993-2005), &quot;Deadwood&quot; (HBO 2005-2006) and &quot;Weeds&quot; (Showtime 2005-2012). Harney&apos;s ability to tap into the emotional and spiritual elements of his characters was the result of substantial training and work on the New York theater scene, as well as his early career path as a social worker and prison reform advocate. After years of anonymity on the Off-Broadway circuit, Harney earned his big break as a morally compromised police officer on &quot;Blue,&quot; which led to steady work as a guest performer on countless series. In 2005, he played a hateful townsperson on &quot;Deadwood,&quot; which further increased his profile; he successful transitioned from recurring turns on various series, including an alcoholic detective on &quot;Weeds,&quot; to his first turn as a series regular on &quot;Orange is the New Black&quot; (2013).</biography>

      <biography>Quite possibly the most underrated and underexposed actor of his caliber and generation, Jeffrey Wright&apos;s undeniable talent and ability to successfully bring to life any role he undertakes is on a par with the most praised and revered A-list actors in the business. Born and raised in Washington DC, Wright graduated from the prestigious Amherst college in 1987. Although he studied Political Science while at Amherst, Wright left the school with something that would prove to be more valuable: a love for acting. Shortly after graduating he won an acting scholarship to NYU, but dropped out after only two months to pursue acting full time. With roles in 1990&apos;s Presumed Innocent, and the Broadway production of Angels in America, (in which he won a well deserved Tony award), within a relatively short time Wright was able to show off his exceptional talent and ability on both stage and screen alike. His first major on-screen performance came in 1996 in the Julian Schnabel directed film Basquiat. Wright&apos;s harrowing performance as the late painter Jean Michele Basquiat was critically acclaimed for its haunting accuracy and raw emotion. With a Tony, a Golden Globe, and an AFI award under his belt, the intensity of Wright&apos;s skill has been proven over and over again. Hopefully the near future will bring an influx of more varied lead roles for black actors so that Wright can continue to astonish his colleagues, critics and fans alike with the intensity of his skill.</biography>

      <birthName>Pacino, Alfredo James</birthName>
      <biography>One of the greatest actors in all of film history, Al Pacino established himself during one of film&apos;s greatest decades, the 1970s, and has become an enduring and iconic figure in the world of American movies. Born on April 25, 1940, in the Bronx, New York, Pacino&apos;s parents (Salvatore and Rose) divorced when he was young. His mother moved them into his grandparents&apos; house. Pacino found himself often repeating the plots and voices of characters he had seen in the movies, one of his favorite activities. Bored and unmotivated in school, the young Al Pacino found a haven in school plays, and his interest soon blossomed into a full-time career. Starting on the stage, he went through a lengthy period of depression and poverty, sometimes having to borrow bus fare to make it to auditions. He made it into the prestigious Actors Studio in 1966, studying under legendary acting coach &apos;Lee Strasberg&apos; (qv), creator of the Method Approach that would become the trademark of many &apos;70s-era actors. After appearing in a string of plays in supporting roles, he finally hit it big with &quot;The Indian Wants the Bronx&quot;, winning an Obie award for the 1966-67 season. That was followed by a Tony Award for &quot;Does the Tiger Wear a Necktie?&quot;. His first feature films made little departure from the gritty realistic stage performances that earned him respect: he played a junkie in _The Panic in Needle Park (1971)_ (qv) after his film debut in _Me, Natalie (1969)_ (qv). What came next would change his life forever. The role of Michael Corleone in _The Godfather (1972)_ (qv) was one of the most sought-after of the time: &apos;Robert Redford (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Warren Beatty (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Jack Nicholson (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Ryan O&apos;Neal (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Robert De Niro&apos; (qv) and a host of others either wanted it or were mentioned for it, but director &apos;Francis Ford Coppola&apos; (qv) had his heart set on the unknown Italian Pacino for the role, although pretty much everyone else--from the studio to the producers to some of the cast members--didn&apos;t want him. Though Coppola won out through slick persuasion, Pacino was in constant fear of being fired during the hellish shoot. Much to his (and Coppola&apos;s) relief, the film was a monster hit that did wonders for everyone&apos;s career, including Pacino&apos;s, and earned him his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Instead of taking on easier projects for the big money he could now command, however, Pacino threw his support behind what he considered tough but important films, such as the true-life crime drama _Serpico (1973)_ (qv) and the tragic real-life bank robbery film _Dog Day Afternoon (1975)_ (qv). He opened eyes around the film world for his brave choice of roles, and he was nominated three consecutive years for the &quot;Best Actor&quot; Academy Award. He faltered slightly with _Bobby Deerfield (1977)_ (qv), but regained his stride with _...And Justice for All. (1979)_ (qv), for which he received another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. This would, unfortunately, signal the beginning of a decline in his career, which produced such critical and commercial flops as _Cruising (1980)_ (qv) and _Author! Author! (1982)_ (qv). He took on another vicious gangster role and cemented his legendary status in the ultra-violent cult hit _Scarface (1983)_ (qv), but a monumental mistake was about to follow. _Revolution (1985)_ (qv) endured an endless and seemingly cursed shoot in which equipment was destroyed, weather was terrible, and Pacino became terribly ill with pneumonia. Constant changes in the script also further derailed a project that seemed doomed from the start anyway. The Revolutionary War film is considered one of the worst films ever, not to mention one of the worst of his career, resulted in his first truly awful reviews and kept him off the screen for the next four years. Returning to the stage, Pacino has done much to give back and contribute to the theatre, which he considers his first love. He directed a film, _The Local Stigmatic (1990)_ (qv), but it remains unreleased. He lifted his self-imposed exile with the striking _Sea of Love (1989)_ (qv) as a hard-drinking cop. It marked the second phase of Pacino&apos;s career, being the first to feature his now famous dark, owl eyes and hoarse, gravelly voice. Returning to the Corleones, he made _The Godfather: Part III (1990)_ (qv) and earned raves for his first comedic role in the colorful _Dick Tracy (1990)_ (qv). This earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and two years later he was nominated for _Glengarry Glen Ross (1992)_ (qv). He went into romantic mode for _Frankie and Johnny (1991)_ (qv). In 1992 he finally won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his amazing performance in _Scent of a Woman (1992)_ (qv). A mixture of technical perfection (he plays a blind man) and charisma, the role was tailor-made for him, and remains a classic. The next few years would see Pacino becoming more comfortable with acting and movies as a business, turning out great roles in great films with more frequency and less of the demanding personal involvement of his wilder days. _Carlito&apos;s Way (1993)_ (qv) proved another gangster classic, as did the epic crime drama _Heat (1995)_ (qv) directed by &apos;Michael Mann (I)&apos; (qv) and co-starring &apos;Robert De Niro&apos; (qv), although they only had a few scenes together. He returned to the director&apos;s chair for the highly acclaimed and quirky Shakespeare adaptation _Looking for Richard (1996)_ (qv). _City Hall (1996)_ (qv), _Donnie Brasco (1997)_ (qv) and _The Devil&apos;s Advocate (1997)_ (qv) all came out in this period. Reteaming with Mann and then &apos;Oliver Stone (I)&apos; (qv), he gave two commanding performances in _The Insider (1999)_ (qv) and _Any Given Sunday (1999)_ (qv). In his personal life, Pacino is one of Hollywood&apos;s most enduring and notorious bachelors, having never been married. He has a daughter, Julie Marie, with acting teacher Jan Tarrant, and a new set of twins with longtime girlfriend &apos;Beverly D&apos;Angelo (I)&apos; (qv). His romantic history includes a long-time romance with &quot;Godfather&quot; co-star &apos;Diane Keaton&apos; (qv). With his intense and gritty performances, Pacino was an original in the acting profession. His Method approach would become the process of many actors throughout time, and his unbeatable number of classic roles has already made him a legend among film buffs and all aspiring actors and directors. His commitment to acting as a profession and his constant screen dominance has established him as one of the movies&apos; true legends.</biography>

He was sent to boarding school in England at the age of 8 and transferred to American high school at the age of 12. Gedeon starred in his first movie (Aunt Maria) when he was 10, his second lead role followed one year later in the American / German co-production Blood and Honor (3 part mini series) as Hartmut Keller. By demand of the American and German Producers each scene was shot once in English and once in German, due to his bilingual upbringing, Gedeon was the only actor who did not have to be dubbed in either version.  Gedeon continuously worked in various projects during school vacations until he dropped out of high school after 11th grade. At this time he concentrated on training for 2 years, attending musical school and taking speech and acting classes on the side.  In 1988 Gedeon starred, next to Tony Curtis and Birol Head On by Fathi Akin), in the motion Picture Welcome to Germany which marked the beginning of his career as a grownup. Since then Gedeon has acted in numerous films, including Acting it Out (German film award/ Movie and Bavarian Film award/Actor) by acclaimed German director Wortman, Silence like Glass by Carl Schenkel and Making Up (Student Academy Award USA/German Film Award) by Katja von Garnier. He also starred in the internationally successful television series Detectiv Rex (sold to over 140 territories) and Kobra 11 (Action series, sold to over 120 territories).  in 2006 Gedeon portrayed Henry Neumann, a Jewish boxer trapped in a boxcar with his family on the way to Auschwitz, in the motion picture The last Train. This challenging part, it seems, was the perfect preparation for the biggest opportunity in his career to date, the part of the Jewish Basterd (Will Wicky) in Quentin Tarantino&apos;s new movie Inglorious Basterds.</biography>

      <gender>MALE</gender>
      <biography>Gregory Stenson grew up on the mean streets of Las Vegas, Nevada. Today we know him as the 6 foot box-office hero, but his growth spurt didn&apos;t occur to late in his teen years, thus his small size made him a target for bullies. The brutalities he endured as a youngster only made him stronger however and has helped to make him the person he is today. Greg has two loving parents and did the best they could with their lower class status. Gregory hated that his family didn&apos;t have all the things they would like to, things they saw while watching programs like The Jefferson&apos;s and Goodtimes. He wished his family could have such luxuries and live like these TV families did. His major goal in life became to do the best he could to make his families life the best it could possibly be!  His grades in school were never the best, and Gregory couldn&apos;t see himself as a suit anyway, so Gregory looked to other avenues to achieve his goal. It was about this time that his body caught up with and surpassed the size of his classmates, and it wasn&apos;t long before the coach of his High School Football Team noticed Gregory on campus. Greg took to Football like a fish to water and excelled greatly, his skills as a Line Backer helped drive his team to two State Championship wins. By his senior year Greg was a hot commodity and had scouts from colleges all over the country looking him over. Greg took his time deciding on who he should go with and finally decided on Antelope Valley College in beautiful Lancaster, California and the outstanding Marauders Football Team. While an odd choice it was nonetheless the one that Gregory made. His reasoning better to be a big fish in a small pond than a big fish in a much larger pond! His talents as a Line Backer once again proved strong here as they did in High School. He brought many victories to his team the Marauders through his tenure with them and was on the Fast Track to an NFL Career when tragedy struck in one the most prolific games of his college career. During the third down as the Quarter Back was looking for a clear Receiver and a shot to bring the team to victory, Gregory was holding the line with all he had. He had already held off to heavy blitzes on his QB but the last push was too much and he was overrun by two Rushers and was left lying on the ground after the play was through. Gregory didn&apos;t get up and his teammates ran to his side, where they found him screaming in agony.  Gregory was rushed to the local hospital where it was found that his Bicep muscle was entirely ripped from his bone. A terrible injury to have and one that took many months of reconstructive surgery and therapy to correct. Unfortunately this spelled the end of Gregory&apos;s football career as the doctor told him one more injury like this and they don&apos;t know what would happen!  Greg became disillusioned with life and fell into a very dark period in his life, (little is known about this part of his life?) but re-emerged a year later with new determination and with his original goal of a better life for himself and his family at the forefront once more. Gregory had endless nights without sleep trying to figure out how he could make his dream come true, then it hit him like a blitz from a forward in his football days. While thinking about the TV shows he loved so much as a kid, he thought he could play those parts as good if not better than say J.J. did on Goodtimes. So with a new resolve he decided to be an actor.  Just as Gregory had chosen an obscure approach to his Football College Career, he again chose the same method on his way to his Hollywood Movie Actor Career. Gregory didn&apos;t head to Los Angeles or New York as most people do, instead he went to back to Sin City itself, Las Vegas. He knew that more and more movies were being shot there and decided that a big fish in a smaller pond was good enough for him this time as well. He signed with many different agencies as soon as he arrived back in Vegas and not surprisingly was given a very warm reception. His good looks and boyish charm did very well for Gregory indeed. As his agents looked for work for him, sometimes staying up very late to make sure Gregory was looked at seriously for some of the bigger roles, Gregory knew he couldn&apos;t just wait for that &quot;right&quot; acting role to come along so he branched off to &quot;character acting.&quot;  His agents found him work at The Aladdin Casino playing a Genie. Greg enjoyed this work immensely, he loved it when the tourists would smile at him and ask for a photo with him, he thought to himself, &quot;Well if this is what its like to be a big-time movie actor, I think I&apos;m gonna love it.&quot; While playing the Genie he continually went out on auditions, sometimes he would miss some of his work playing Genie, but his producers understood his need to move his career along and gave him time off as needed. While he had not won any parts on the screen or TV yet, he continually tried, knocking down many barriers as he tried. After a year of playing Genie he thought he had explored all the realms of the character so he decided he needed something fresh as it wasn&apos;t fair to him or &quot;Genie&quot; to keep playing a character he saw as &quot;evolved&quot;. So without another job to go to he bid the Aladdin farewell.  But it wasn&apos;t long before Caesar&apos;s Palace heard Gregory was available and immediately made an offer to him to play &quot;Marc Anthony&quot; at their casino. Gregory couldn&apos;t believe his luck, the role of Marc Anthony was one of the most sought-after roles in Vegas. Here he was being offered the role without even an audition! Gregory loved his new role and explored all facets of the character in his day to day workings.  Greg&apos;s movie career also got a shot in the arm at this time as well. One of his agents found him a very small role in the comedy hit &quot;Bubble Boy&quot;. Greg played of all things a security guard in this picture, having never had any experience as a security guard in real life, he learned all he could about his role, going as far as doing temp work as one, before filming started to get an idea of what the character should be about. When the time came to shoot Gregory was more than ready, and brought to the part more that even the writer had hoped to see. Gregory was on his way!  While he continued his Marc Anthony role he went for more and more auditions, picking up a commercial or music video starring role along the way. Gregory&apos;s biggest break came when &quot;Bubble Boy&quot; was released and one of the producers assistants of _Ocean&apos;s Eleven (2001)_ (qv), &apos;Harvey Weintrapper&apos; saw Gregory and his performance. In the script of _Ocean&apos;s Eleven (2001)_ (qv) there was a part for a white security officer, and this part was very critical to the unfolding of the whole plot of the movie. Weintrapper called Gregory in and gave him a shot at the part, Gregory with all his zeal again researched the part prior to the meeting. To understand the role he shadowed one of Caesar&apos;s Hotel security men for a day to see what it was all about. When Gregory read the part, Weintrapper was blown away, he had expected a great read from Gregory but this was beyond all expectations. Even though Gregory differed from the original characters concept, they decided to take a chance.  _Ocean&apos;s Eleven (2001)_ (qv) became a stunning hit spectacular and owed this in no small way to Gregory Stenson&apos;s portrayal of The Sentry in his stunning scene that featured him along with two actors each from a Dynasty of acting Royalty. Gregory&apos;s role paired him up against the dynamic Scott Caan (James Caan&apos;s Son) and Casey Affleck (Ben Affleck&apos;s Brother and best buddy as well of Matt Damon). Both Scott and Casey were most impressed with Gregory&apos;s work and invited him to hang out with them after the shoot thus beginning a friendship that lasts to this day. It is a little known secret around insider circles that the three of them are looking at a &quot;western&quot; script to do together.</biography>

      <biography>James Martin Kelly was born in 1954 in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, New York. Within a few years he moved to suburban Valley Stream, Long Island where at the age of 11 he performed on stage as a musician singing, playing the guitar and drums. By the 1980s Jim was a published songwriter and performer working in the recording studios and nightclubs of New York in lower Manhattan. To supplement his income and now married to Mary-Ellen of Long Island and with children, Jim became a postman with the US Postal Service. He secured a transfer to Hudson, Florida, but once there he realized there were many less opportunities in the music industry that he loved so much. His wife saw an advertisement on the television for auditions for the community theater and encouraged Jim to go, where he soon learned the trade of rejection. But he didn&apos;t give up. He played Beadle in &quot;Sweeny Todd&quot; at the Richey Suncoast Theater. A director of another show saw Jim and booked him in his show, this led to one engagement after another including Alan Squire in &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot;. Jim at this time had agents in the Tampa area and they were sending him out on several auditions landing him work in commercials. Being in constant demand he had to make the choice whether to take the risk and leave the Post Office or pursue his acting career full time. He chose the latter and has no regrets at all. He decided to go with the agent that got him the best and most consistent work, which was Melanie Hurt of the Hurt Agency, Orlando. He has attended workshops with Kathy Laughlin in Tampa, Lori Wyman in Miami and several others. He spent 3 years learning the Eric Morris Technique at the Performers Studio perfecting scene study. Recently he attended a Primetime Audition workshop in New York with &apos;Julie Tucker&apos; who casts for the TV show _&quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (1999) _. Jim has appeared on _&quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; (1993)_ (qv) as mob boss Billy Bob Jackson in three episodes where his New York accent came in handy. He also appeared in _&quot;Safe Harbor&quot; (1999)_ (qv). In _&quot;Noah Knows Best&quot; (2000)_ (qv), shot at Universal, he played Big Frankie, Hanson&apos;s bodyguard. Jim played &quot;Mack&apos; the owner of the Big Ace Saloon on _&quot;Dawson&apos;s Creek&quot; (1998)_ (qv). In between theater and television, he hosted his own show: &quot;Kelly&apos;s Cellar&quot;, on public television, when he and his wife produced the series. His guests consisted of comedians, musicians and actors and ran for two years.  Some of his films include _Olive Juice (2001)_ (qv), which recently premiered in Orlando. In _Animal Factory (2000)_ (qv) with &apos;Steve Buscemi&apos; (qv) and &apos;Willem Dafoe&apos; (qv), he played a correctional guard who has a rough face-to-face confrontation with Davoe. His most recent film, shot in Miami, was _Big Trouble (2002)_ (qv) directed by &apos;Barry Sonnerfeld&apos;, when he played a Geo Salesman trying to sell a car. He also has a film To Kill A Lawyer (2001) soon to be shown at the Tampa Bay Film Festival. The film was shot in Tarpon Springs.  Jim is very proud of his eighteen-year-old daughter Amanda who was given a full scholarship to Southern Methodist University for vocal performance. Music seems to run in the family. His sixteen-year-old daughter, Vanessa, is interested in acting and film. Her fascination seems to be in continuity in films. Thirteen-year-old Jim Jr. is into painting, sculpting and now his historical interest is in building ancient medieval armaments. Colin, twelve, is into skateboarding. When not working as an actor, Jim spends all of his time with his family just hanging out together, living outside Los Angeles.</biography>

      <biography>Born into a wealthy and influential English family, Ian Fleming spent his early years attending top British schools such as Eton and Sandhurst military academy. He took to writing while schooling in Kitzbuhel, Austria, and upon failing the entrance requirements for Foreign Service joined the news agency Reuters as a journalist -- winning the respect of his peers for his coverage of a &quot;show trial&quot; in Russia of several Royal Engineers on espionage charges. Fleming briefly worked in the financial sector for the family bank, but just prior to the Second World War, was recruited into British Naval Intelligence where he excelled, shortly achieving the rank of Commander. When the war ended, Fleming retired to Jamaica where he built a house called &quot;Goldeneye,&quot; took up writing full-time and created the character that would make him famous -- British Secret Service agent James Bond, in a novel called &quot;Casino Royale.&quot; Fleming spent the rest of his life writing and traveling the world, but as his Bond character reached new heights of popularity on movie screens, Fleming was in ailing health. He died of a heart attack (his second) in England in August 1964 at the age of 56.</biography>

      <biography>Known throughout the music industry as the &quot;king of jungle&quot;, Goldie is an artist whose ferocious creativity knows no bounds. Born and bred on the breakdancing and hip-hop culture he absorbed during trips to the States in his youth, Goldie was a graffitti artist and an album cover artist before receiving the backing to record his first track, &quot;Terminator&quot;, in 1993. His debut album, &quot;Timeless&quot;, followed two years later, and was hailed by critics as a masterpiece. The album fused the hypersyncopated breakbeats and reggae chic common in jungle music with a provocative bassline and soulful diva vocals. That album&apos;s title track, a 21-minute symphonic piece, was a masterstroke, and the lively &quot;Inner City Life&quot; was a smash. With his reputation firmly established, he released his sophomore album in 1998, Saturnzreturn. The album&apos;s opening track, &quot;Mother&quot; a 60-minute orchestral/drum-n-bass piece, is a haunting track and serves as the companion piece to &quot;Timeless.&quot; The remainder of the album, featuring cameos by &apos;David Bowie&apos; (qv), &apos;Noel Gallagher (II)&apos; (qv) of &apos;Oasis (I)&apos; (qv), and rapper &apos;KRS-One&apos; (qv), is a mishmash of Goldie&apos;s signature sound. Critics were not impressed with this follow-up effort, however; many lambasted the album as too &quot;self-indulgent&quot;. Nonetheless, no one can deny that Goldie is an artist who will continue to amaze his fans and the industry with his epic scope and syncopated vision.</biography>

      <birthDateAsString>15 March 1970</birthDateAsString>
      <biography>Curtis Rivers was born in Guisborough, North Yorkshire, England in 1970.  He vividly recalls his ambition to become a professional movie stuntman, which began at the age of 8, when he started to send letters to numerous TV stations in order to find out how to achieve this goal.  He was told that he would have to become a professional actor, and highly skilled in no fewer than 6 different disciplines, such as Judo, Fencing, Horse Riding, SCUBA Diving and Parachuting.  Unfazed, he was acting by the age of 12, running half-marathons at 14, SCUBA diving at 15 and skydiving by 16.  On leaving school, Curtis began organising various expeditions and adventures, while adding new skills to his stunt training. Adventures led him as far as the Transylvanian Alps, The Black Sea and beyond.  In his early twenties, he became a professional actor, stage work including a national tour of the U.K. and Ireland, and TV work including the role of Detective Constable Galley in the popular TV Series &quot;The Chief&quot;.  In 1996, at the age of 25, he finally fulfilled his life-long ambition of joining the elite ranks of The British Stunt Register, skilled to the highest levels in Judo, Jujitsu, Taekwondo, Tang Soo Do, Sport Parachuting, Fencing, Riding, High Diving, SCUBA Diving, Hang-Gliding, Trampolining, and Power Boating.  Within just a few short weeks, Rivers found himself doubling for stars such as Hollywood actor Patrick Bergen (Sleeping With The Enemy with Julia Roberts).  In the years that followed, Curtis worked on numerous movies and television shows, including the Bond film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, which saw him killed by Bond no fewer than 5 times! In the 2002 swashbuckling epic &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, Rivers did all of the fencing, riding and even underwater stunts for the star, Hollywood actor James Caviezal (Mel Gibson&apos;s &quot;Passion of the Christ&quot;, &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; and &quot;Frequency&quot;).  Rivers has also been a regular stunt performer on popular British TV shows such as Casualty, Holby, The Bill, Emmerdale, Ashes to Ashes, Spooks, Doctor Who, Torchwood, Whitechapel, and Midsomer Murders, whilst working on various overseas TV projects.  By 2000, Rivers began to seek new avenues for his talents, and added promotional and P.R. work to his growing list of skills. He promoted the launch of Extreme Magazine in 2000, by coordinating the cover shoot - which saw him reading the magazine 20 metres beneath the Caribbean Ocean, in shark-infested waters! He also wrote a feature for the magazine.  This led to a number of similar magazine promotions, such as Dubai&apos;s SMART magazine (which saw him reading the magazine whilst hanging from a crane - 200ft above the ground!) and also led to him writing various featured articles, for numerous magazines and newspapers all over the world.  By 2001, his successful marketing and P.R. campaigns led to the funding of his first Guinness World Record.  Never opting for the easy life, Rivers chose a world record that had remained intact for over 45 years, despite numerous attempts to better it. The record he chose to attempt was The Longest Duration Parachute Jump.  This project saw him training in industrial freezers as the air temperature at jump altitude would be 60 degrees below freezing. It also required high altitude chamber training with the SAS, and numerous test jumps on oxygen from high altitude.  On 14 February 2002, Rivers took off from Pozoblanco, Spain, and flew in a hot-air balloon to 25,000ft above the earth. He jumped from the balloon and activated his parachute immediately. With skillful canopy control, he over-flew the Andalucian Mountains and flew into the Guinness Book of Records with a flight time of 45 minutes.  This bettered the long-standing official record by 5 whole minutes.  Enjoying the widespread publicity, his sponsors Damart Thermals agreed to fund his next world record attempt. This time he set his sights firmly on the Highest Bungee Jump.  The official Guinness World Record was 8,500ft. However, an unofficial claim came to the attention of Rivers and his team, a claim of a bungee jump from a balloon flying 10,500ft high!  Curtis therefore set his sights higher still, on a jump from the limits of where a human can breathe without oxygen after taking off from sea level - 15,000ft.  On 5 May 2002, Rivers bungee jumped from a hot-air balloon flying 15,200ft above Puertolano in Spain, and was awarded his second Guinness World Record.  Footage of the jump went global, earning his sponsor over £470,000 worth of publicity in the U.K. alone, and over £1million of worldwide publicity and brand promotion.  Rivers still works in the TV &amp; Film business, now also in demand for his skills as both Stunt Coordinator and 2nd Unit (Action) Director.</biography>

      <birthName>Taylor, Rodney Sturt</birthName>
      <biography>Suave and handsome Australian actor who came to Hollywood in the 1950s, and built himself up from a supporting actor into taking the lead in several well-remembered movies. Arguably his most fondly remembered role was that as George (Herbert George Wells), the inventor, in &apos;George Pal&apos; (qv)&apos;s spectacular _The Time Machine (1960)_ (qv). As the movie finished with George, and his best friend Filby &apos;Alan Young (I)&apos; (qv) seemingly parting forever, both actors were brought back together in 1993 to film a 30 minute epilogue to the original movie! Taylor&apos;s virile, matinée idol looks also assisted him in scoring the lead of Mitch Brenner in &apos;Alfred Hitchcock (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s creepy thriller _The Birds (1963)_ (qv), the role of &apos;Jane Fonda&apos; (qv)&apos;s love interest in _Sunday in New York (1963)_ (qv), the title role in &apos;John Ford (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s biopic of Irish playwright &apos;Sean O&apos;Casey&apos; (qv) in _Young Cassidy (1965)_ (qv), and a co-starring role in _The Train Robbers (1973)_ (qv) with &apos;John Wayne (I)&apos; (qv). Taylor also appeared as &apos;Bette Davis&apos; (qv) future son-in-law in the well-received film _The Catered Affair (1956)_ (qv). He also gave a sterling performance as the German-American Nazi Major trying to fool &apos;James Garner (I)&apos; (qv) in _36 Hours (1965)_ (qv). Later Taylor made many westerns and action movies during the 1960s and 1970s; however, none of them were much better than &quot;B pictures&quot; and failed to push his star to the next level. Aditionally, Taylor was cast as the lead in several TV series including _&quot;Bearcats!&quot; (1971)_ (qv), _&quot;Masquerade&quot; (1983)_ (qv), and _&quot;Outlaws&quot; (1986)_ (qv); however, none of them truly ignited viewer interest, and they were canceled after only one or two seasons. Most fans would agree that Rod Taylor&apos;s last great role was in the wonderful Australian film _The Picture Show Man (1977)_ (qv), about a traveling side show bringing &quot;moving pictures&quot; to remote towns in the Australian outback.</biography>

      <biography>Ross Cook was born in Newburyport, MA. He has four sisters and a brother. His family moved to Mandeville, LA in 1987 and have been there ever since. After graduating from high school he joined the Air Force where he served for eight years working as a crew chief on the F-15 Eagle. He was awarded several medals during his tenure including the Air Force Commendation Medal and was also voted Crew Chief of the Year by his peers of the 159th Fighter Wing. After leaving the service, he married his college sweetheart Kate Butler. In 2009 Ross and a couple of friends bought the LSU &quot;staple hangout&quot; Bogie&apos;s Bar in Baton Rouge and they still own it today. Once the bar was working the way all the partners thought it should, Ross had more free time to explore other interests, such as acting. Ever since Ross was a child he had an affinity for movies. With the help of a friend, he started dabbling in background work and immediately took a liking to it. Ross has now done fifteen movies/shows and is always looking forward to his next role.</biography>

      <biography>Jamie&apos;s mother, Louise, was an adopted child. When her marriage to his father failed, his grandparents, Mark and Estelle Talley, stepped in and, at age 7 months, adopted him too. He says he had a very rigid upbringing that placed him in the Boy Scouts and the church choir. During high school, he played quarterback for his high school team and was good enough that he got press in Dallas newspapers. He studied music in college. He released a music album in 1994, &quot;Peep This&quot; and sings the theme song for his 1999 movie, _Any Given Sunday (1999)_ (qv). However, in 1989, his life changed when a girl friend challenged him to get up onstage at the Comedy Club. In fact, he says he took his androgynous stage name because he learned that women got preference for mike time on open stage nights. That led to his being cast in _&quot;Roc&quot; (1991)_ (qv) and _&quot;In Living Color&quot; (1990)_ (qv) and ultimately to his own WB network TV series. He has a daughter, Corrine, born in 1995, who lives with her mother.</biography>

His first name is Christopher, and he hated being called Chris in school, so he changed it to Topher as time went on. He attended New Hampshire&apos;s Brewster Academy and the University of Southern California.  Grace dropped out of USC to start his show business career in _&quot;That &apos;70s Show&quot; (1998)_ (qv) at age 20. He was cast in that show because the show&apos;s creators, &apos;Bonnie Turner&apos; (qv) and &apos;Terry Turner (I)&apos; (qv), saw him act in a high-school play--their daughter attended same high school. Apart from school plays, Grace had absolutely no acting experience before landing the role of Eric Forman.</biography>

      <birthName>Llewelyn, Desmond Wilkinson</birthName>
      <biography>Desmond Llewelyn was born in South Wales in 1914, the son of a coal mining engineer. In high school, he worked as a stagehand in the school&apos;s productions and then picked up sporadic small parts. His family would not give up their effort to prevent him from a life on stage, so an uncle who was a high ranking police officer arranged for Llewelyn to take the department&apos;s physical exam. &quot;Thank God, I flunked the eye test, and they wouldn&apos;t take me. I suspect the inspector had a hangover because he also failed this other chap I knew, who went out the same day and passed the physical for the Royal Navy, which had a lot tougher test.&quot; After failing the police exam, Llewelyn thought about becoming a minister, realizing after a week-long retreat of quiet and meditation that the ministry &quot;was definitely not for me.&quot; Llewelyn persevered in his acting quest, and was accepted to the Royal Academy for the Dramatic Arts in the mid 1930s. The outbreak of World War II in September 1939, halted his acting career, and Llewelyn was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the British army. He was assigned to the Royal Welsh Fusiliers and was sent to France in early 1940. In a short time, his regiment was fighting the Germans, and Llewelyn&apos;s company was holding off a division of German tanks. Llewelyn explained that &quot;eventually, the tanks broke through and many of us jumped into this canal and started swimming down it to the other side, figuring that our chaps were still over there. But the Germans were the only ones there,&quot; and Llewelyn was captured, and held as a prisoner of war for five years. At one prison camp, the prisoners had dug a tunnel and were planning to escape the next morning. Llewelyn was down in the tunnel doing some maintenance work in preparation of the escape when the Germans found out about the tunnel and caught him down in it, a crime that earned Llewelyn 10 days in solitary, which Llewelyn called &quot;a blessing of sorts. After spending every day of several years sleeping in a room with 50 other people, the quiet and privacy was rather nice.&quot; After the war, Llewelyn returned to London and revived his career, eventually being cast as his trademark Q in _From Russia with Love (1963)_ (qv). Since 1963, Llewelyn has appeared as Q in every Eon Productions Bond film, except _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv). Llewelyn was omitted from _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv) because producers &apos;Harry Saltzman&apos; (qv) and &apos;Albert R. Broccoli&apos; (qv) felt that too much was being made of the gadgets and they would play it down. Llewelyn said he &quot;was quite disappointed&quot; at being left out of _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv). Fans, however, missed Q, and Llewelyn got a call shortly after the release of _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv) telling him that he would be in the next Bond film, _The Man with the Golden Gun (1974)_ (qv). Llewelyn, who admits that his mechanical abilities in real life are virtually nil, is geared up for the next Bond movie. &quot;I&apos;d love to be in the next one,&quot; Llewelyn said. &quot;Of course, if you consider my age, they should have put me out to grass a long time ago.&quot;</biography>

      <biography>Nikki was born Sept 2nd, 1997 in Rochelle, Illinois, a town of what is now about 10,000. Rochelle and surrounding communities have also been home to some of Hollywood&apos;s biggest celebrities (Joan Allen and Cindy Crawford to name a couple) and several movies have been filmed on location there. Nikki found her way into acting when she was just four years old. A photographer that had shot some yearly photos of Nikki liked the results from the shoot and proceeded to show some talent agents in the area. Soon Nikki was lucky enough to acquire representation in Chicago and in LA. Coincidentally at the same time she was cast as Raven, an adorable little vampire in the award-winning short Teenage Bikini Vampire and was also cast in her first feature film The Rockville Slayer. During this time she was also contacted by Mali Finn, one of Hollywood&apos;s top casting directors to audition for the role of Jennifer Connelly&apos;s daughter in Dark Water. Nikki eventually lost the role to actress Ariel Gade but with her path already set and seemingly being led by fate, decided to immerse herself full force into the world of entertainment. Her willingness to work hard, mannerism and dedication has helped her greatly in her achievements. Nikki loves all aspects of the film industry and isn&apos;t afraid to jump in and help out whenever she can.  Nikki also loves to write! With the support of many she was fortunate enough to bring one of her own stories to life. She also stars in, co-directed and produced the project (more details to come soon). Nikki has appeared at award ceremonies and conventions. One of her fondest memories came when she was invited to co-host The Dragon Con Independent Film Awards with long time actor Dean Stockwell. She has also been featured several times in Fangoria, one of America&apos;s top Horror magazines and is a current Member of The Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror and The Burbank Tournament of Roses Association. Nikki is also an avid supporter of children&apos;s charities and is also the co-founder of Buggaboo Books, a non-profit organization that puts books into school libraries. Nikki has an extensive list of credits that include print, voice over, music videos,commercials and films. Some of her print work consists of SC Johnson,Scott Foresman, Gap, Tapco, AJ Prindle and RC Toys. She has also done commercials for Chevrolet and several music videos. One of Nikki&apos;s most current and favorite voice over projects is The New Testament Youth Edition Audio Bible starring some of Hollywood&apos;s hottest young Celebes like Corbin Bleu, Anna Sophia Robb, Emily Osment,Sean Astin and Marshall Allman.  Thus far Nikki has worked on well over a dozen feature films. Past projects include POTC-Dead Mans Chest, Dork of the Rings, Crazy love, Broke Sky, The Promotion, Dog Jack and Rob Zombies Halloween. Some current projects are Leading Ladies, Fallen Souls, The Twilight Zone Radio Dramas, the highly anticipated Johnny Violence and Satanic Panic(also produced by Nikki) due out later this year. Nikki also has her own production company and is working on several new project including a pilot made for television. Nikki has been blessed with the opportunity to travel and to work alongside some of the most passionate and dedicated people in the industry such as Gore Verbinski, Nic Cage,Jerry Bruckheimer, Jeff Burr, Matt Damon, Steven Soderbergh , Steve Conrad, Orlando Bloom, Sean William Scott, Reiko Aylesworth, Keira Knightley and many more. She looks forward to meeting many new people and to welcoming with much anticipation all the opportunities that lie ahead.</biography>

      <biography>Sean Bean, England&apos;s most versatile actor, holds a stellar career spanning every medium for approximately 20 years, in theater, radio, television and movies. This soulful, green-eyed blonde&apos;s roles are so varied that his magnetic persona convincing plays angst-ridden villians, as in &quot;Clarissa,&quot; passionate lovers like Mellors in &quot;Lady Chatterley&apos;s Lover,&quot; rough-and-ready soldiers such as Richard Sharpe, heartwrenching warriors as the emotionally torn Boromir in &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; and noble Greeks, like Odysseus in &quot;Troy,&quot; where his very presence in the film adds grace and validity to the rest of the movie.  Recently, he did a turn in Shakespeare&apos;s &quot;Macbeth,&quot; where as the principal lead, he so transfixed the audience that the show was extended in London and critically acclaimed.  Bean, however, remains himself, a man&apos;s man, and in the glizty world of movies this is a rare thing indeed. Bean currently resides in London where he enjoys raising his beautiful daughters, his beloved football, and the occasional pint. In his home country of England, he was recently voted the second sexiest man in the UK, and seemed to enjoy this notoriety, stating, &quot;I don&apos;t have any problems with women seeing me as their ideal bit of &apos;rough&apos;. Why would I?&quot; Well, good to know, because his legions of fans do not have a problem with it either.</biography>

      <biography>Henry Silva was born on September 15, 1928 in Brooklyn, New York City. He quit public school to attend drama classes at age 13, supporting himself as a dishwasher in a Manhattan hotel. By 1955, Silva had moved up from dishwasher to waiter, and felt ready to audition for the Actors Studio. He was one of five students chosen out of more than 2500 applicants. When the Actors Studio staged &apos;Michael V. Gazzo&apos; (qv)&apos;s play &quot;A Hatful of Rain&quot; as a classroom project, it proved so successful it came to Broadway--with students &apos;Ben Gazzara (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Shelley Winters&apos; (qv), &apos;Harry Guardino&apos; (qv), &apos;Anthony Franciosa (I)&apos; (qv) and, of course, Silva in key roles. Called to Hollywood, he played a succession of heavies in films, including _The Bravados (1958)_ (qv), _Green Mansions (1959)_ (qv), _Ocean&apos;s Eleven (1960)_ (qv), _The Manchurian Candidate (1962)_ (qv) and _Johnny Cool (1963)_ (qv).  An Italian producer made Henry an offer he could not refuse--to star as a hero for a change--and he moved his family overseas. Silva&apos;s turning-point picture was a spaghetti western, _Un fiume di dollari (1966)_ (qv), which made him a hot box office commodity in Spain, Italy, Germany and France. His popularity was enhanced by a gift for languages. He speaks Italian and Spanish fluently and has a flair for the kind of gritty, realistic roles that also catapulted &apos;Charles Bronson (I)&apos; (qv) to European stardom. Returning to the United States, he co-starred with &apos;Frank Sinatra&apos; (qv) in the film _Contract on Cherry Street (1977) (TV)_ (qv), then signed on as Buck Rogers&apos; evil adversary Kane in _Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (1979) (TV)_ (qv) and the television series of the same name. Silva now calls the San Fernando Valley home, but makes continual film forays back to Europe&apos;s production centers. A dedicated jogger, he puts in five miles a day &quot;to keep in shape and relieve tension&quot;.</biography>

      <biography>Movies made from Michael France&apos;s screenplays have earned well over one billion dollars in worldwide theatrical admissions, and at least another billion dollars in home video revenues. Michael France was born in 1962. He graduated from the University of Florida and attended Columbia University&apos;s School Of The Arts.  His breakthrough screenplay was his 1991 spec sale for Cliffhanger to Carolco Pictures - the movie was shot within the year and became a worldwide hit in 1993 for Sylvester Stallone and Renny Harlin. France then went on to revive the then-dormant James Bond franchise with his script for GoldenEye, which again yielded a worldwide hit in 1995 - and France&apos;s association with the James Bond franchise continued with uncredited work in The World Is Not Enough, which was released in 1999.  France&apos;s string of Marvel adaptations began with Hulk (2003) for Universal Pictures, continued with The Punisher (2004) for Lions Gate, and went further with the blockbuster release of Fantastic Four (2005) for Twentieth Century Fox.  He lived in Florida with his wife Elizabeth, son Thomas, and twin daughters Annabelle and Carolynn. He died in April 2013 aged 51.</biography>

      <biography>Wade Eastwood was born in Durban, South Africa in 1971, the youngest of 4 children. He finished junior school there before his family moved to England. The weather and lifestyle eventually forced a family decision to move back home to SA after 5 years. Once home, Wade finished high school, represented his country in Athletics (100M &amp; 200M sprints) and went in to the Army to complete his compulsory National Service.  Wade was 19 when he finished the army and landed his first film job. He had been working as a volunteer lifeguard and part of his duty included air sea rescue along Durban&apos;s beaches. A film company came to town and was scouting for soldier types to jump out of a helicopter as it flared to a stop over a crocodile infested river. Wade was chosen by the Director. After this stunt he was hooked and worked his way, (The hard way) through the ranks, driving, crashing, falling, burning etc....  After 7 years of performing and stunt coordinating feature films, TV shows and commercial&apos;s in South Africa, Wade wanted to move on to bigger and better projects with larger budgets and more scope to create unique action, thus he moved to the UK. Here he worked back to back doubling Brendan Fraser on The Mummy, Pierce Brosnan on The Bond Movies and Gerard Butler and Daniel Craig on The Tomb Raider Films, to name a few.  The only thing missing for Wade was the outdoor life, so he decided to make the move to California where he could work and still enjoy his hometown sports, such as surfing, climbing, motorcycle &amp; car racing etc...  Since moving to Los Angeles, Wade has stunt doubled Brad Pitt, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Ewan McGregor and many others as well as been nominated for 4 Taurus World Stunt awards for Best Stunt Coordination (Troy), best overall stunt by a stuntman (Terminator 3), best work with a vehicle (Terminator 3) and Best Stunt Coordinator (Salt).</biography>

      <biography>Dana Gourrier (pronounced Gu-Ree-A) is a native of New Orleans with ancestry dating back 7 generations. Since 8 years old she has been in front of audiences performing: be it singing, dancing, or acting. Her true love of theater began when she was 14 years old at the New Orleans Recreational Department Theater under the program&apos;s long-time, late director, Ty Tracy. After receiving her BFA in Performance Art from UL Lafayette, she went to New York in higher pursuits. She continued her studies participating in a five week program studying acting in affiliation with NYU. That summer, Dana saw Shakespeare in the Park&apos;s Twelfth Night, which inspired her. At the end of the program and with no place to live, Dana made the bold decision to stay in New York. Eventually she found a tiny studio in Spanish Harlem, waited tables, auditioned, gigged, did background vocals, and even taught theater at a community center in Brooklyn. Dana has performed and also produced original work at: The Red Room Theater, Birdland, Lennox Lounge, Alvin Ailey Citigroup Theater, Under St. Mark&apos;s, The Cherry Lane Theater, Summer Stages in Central Park, and La Mama Theater. At La Mama Theater, Dana was apart of a project called Soulagraphie: a series of plays about genocide written by renowned playwright Eric Ehn. She played the title character Maria Kizito: a play about a Rwandan Nun that was tried and convicted of aiding in the death of thousands.  In 2010, Dana completed her MFA in Acting from the reputable California Institute of the Arts, where she was in two world premieres and a long list of other full theatrical productions both Classic and Contemporary. Upon graduating, she came straight home and broke into Hollywood South, as Film and Television were also her great loves. Dana had one goal when deciding to move back home; it was to be on HBO&apos;s Treme; the David Simon executively produced show about her hometown. Not only was she on it, but she landed a recurring role.  Since then Dana has worked with some of Hollywood&apos;s biggest Academy Award Winners and Nominees. It all began when she landed the role of Cora in Winner Quentin Tarantino&apos;s Django Unchained. She felt so welcomed and connected to Quentin. She pitched ideas about her character to him, including a song for the funeral scene, which was shot, but would eventually land on the cutting room floor. Her next endeavor was working with Nominee Lee Daniels&apos; on his film, The Butler. She portrayed the role of Helen Holloway, wife of James Holloway, played by Lenny Kravitz.  Additionally, Dana has worked directly with Academy Award Winners and Nominees: Angela Bassett, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jamie Foxx, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Woody Harrelson, Samuel L. Jackson, Jessica Lang, Christoph Waltz, Forest Whitaker, and Oprah Winfrey!  Dana considers herself Tri-Costal, but currently resides in New Orleans, which will always be home.</biography>

      <biography>Fatimah Taliah is a film and television actress whose journey began as young local talent in Chicago. Her journey has never been easy but when dreams are obtained when doubt is replaced by determination. Fashion and film were long time fantasies that are now coming true for Fatimah Taliah. The art of entertainment has always been a passion since the age of 4. While pursuing a degree in dance and theater at Columbia College in 2004, a twist of fate turned her focus to modeling. An Elite model introduced Fatimah to a modeling agent which landed her a contract with Elite after being spotted walking in a fashion show a friend put together for his class assignment at Columbia. This came after she tried over 100 open modeling calls for the agency and was turned down every time. Destiny definitely took over for Fatimah at that moment and her resume proves it. She has walked for Jennifer Lopez, Glamorama, and Project Runways Macy&apos;s events. Her commercial catalogs include Ashley Furniture, Crème of Nature, Allstate Insurance, and Walmart; to name a few. She has done local stage plays and began her professional career entertaining as a backup dancer for R&amp;B singer, Syleena Johnson co-star of R&amp;B Divas. Although modeling swept Fatimah off into the world of fashion, she never forgot about her love for acting and found a common link between the two. Fatimah keeps balance in both art forms with preparation and planning. Acting classes, fashion magazines and blogs help her stay current on the trends in both of her crafts. She looks forward to her own line of fashion one day and would love to play the villain in a feature film. It&apos;s all in the creative process that excites her. Every success story has its setbacks. Fatimah is very aware of hers - being a brown black woman with the &quot;right look&quot; for Hollywood. She knows people go with what they know and fear taking chances. Her competition is tough. There are days she sheds tears and wants to give up, but frustration only makes Fatimah determined. So in 2012, Fatimah moved from Chicago to L.A. without looking back and signed to InfiniteSpin Management in 2013.</biography>

      <birthName>Wopat, Thomas S.</birthName>
      <biography>He&apos;ll forever be remembered as strapping, good ol&apos; boy Luke Duke, the virile, blue-eyed, dark-haired, plaid-shirted rascal (equally good-looking &apos;John Schneider (I)&apos; (qv) was the strapping, plaid-shirted blond cousin) on the rough-and-tumble bucolic 80s series _&quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; (1979)_ (qv). Where others may have fallen by the TV wayside, however, after the cancellation of such a popular series, Wopat moved on and reverted back to his first true love - music - successfully refocusing as a recording artist and musical leading man of Broadway and regional shows.  The highly engaging Wisconsin native was born one of six brothers and sisters to a dairy farmer in 1951. Tom began singing and dancing in school musicals from age 12 and, following high school graduation, decided to avidly pursue music as a viable profession. Studying at the University of Wisconsin he dropped out to front a rock band as both guitarist and lead singer, and later gained on-stage experience in such musicals as &quot;South Pacific&quot;, &quot;West Side Story&quot; and &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;.  Appearing off-Broadway in 1978 before making his Broadway debut that same year as a replacement actor in the musical &quot;I Love My Wife&quot;, other book shows came his way including &quot;The Robber Bridegroom&quot; and the lead in &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; With solid, down-home good looks and appeal, it didn&apos;t take long for Hollywood to check him out. By 1979 Tom was co-starring in (and later sometimes directing) episodes of his own popular action-packed series while he and Schneider wrangled heartthrob status in the teen magazines. The backwoods show lasted six seasons, although at one point he and Schneider left the series after contract negotiations broke down. Briefly replaced, the show wasn&apos;t the same without them and they eventually were brought back. During the show&apos;s run, Tom kick-started his recording career with his first (and self-titled) country album release in 1983. His output went on to include six other country albums before finally releasing a 2000 album of standard love songs.  After the end of his series, Wopat made do in a couple of mini-movie vehicles and a few short-lived series before scoring again on TV as &apos;Cybill Shepherd&apos; (qv)&apos; ex-husband/stuntman on her own sitcom series in 1995. Better yet, he resharpened his musical theater skills. He returned with commanding baritone leads in &quot;Carousel&quot; (1986), &quot;City of Angels&quot; (1990) and &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1992) (as Skye Masterson). In 1999 he recreated the sharp-shooting Frank Butler role opposite &apos;Bernadette Peters&apos; (qv) in the popular Broadway revival of &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; and earned a Tony nomination in the process.  It&apos;s only gotten sweeter. Guesting for the Cincinnati Symphony and Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestras in programs featuring Broadway&apos;s finest music, he has continued on the New York stage with successive roles in &quot;42nd Street&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot; (as slick lawyer Billy Flynn). In 2005 he more than held his own in his first straight-acting Broadway part as part of the excellent ensemble in the Tony-winning (for &quot;Best Revival of a Play&quot;) production of &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; starring acting heavyweights &apos;Alan Alda&apos; (qv) and &apos;Liev Schreiber&apos; (qv). That same year Wopat embarked on a 33-date national &quot;Over The Rainbow&quot; tour with &apos;Faith Prince&apos; (qv) featuring the gorgeous songs of &apos;Harold Arlen&apos; (qv), a tour that included Carnegie Hall.</biography>

      <birthName>DiCaprio, Leonardo Wilhelm</birthName>
      <biography>Few actors in the world have had a career quite as diverse as Leonardo DiCaprio&apos;s. DiCaprio has gone from relatively humble beginnings, as a supporting cast member of the sitcom _&quot;Growing Pains&quot; (1985)_ (qv) and low budget horror movies, such as _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv), to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s, as the hunky lead actor in movies such as _Romeo + Juliet (1996)_ (qv) and _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), to then become a leading man in Hollywood blockbusters, made by internationally renowned directors such as &apos;Martin Scorsese&apos; (qv) and &apos;Christopher Nolan (I)&apos; (qv). But such a rich, varied career is what you would expect from someone who has had such an unusual upbring as DiCaprio.  Leonardo DiCaprio is the only child of former comic book artist &apos;George DiCaprio (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Irmelin DiCaprio&apos; (qv) (both born 1943). Leonardo&apos;s father, George, had achieved minor status as an artist and distributor of cult comic book titles, and was even depicted in several issues of American Splendor, the cult semi-autobiographical comic book series by the late &apos;Harvey Pekar&apos;, a friend of George&apos;s. However, Leonardo&apos;s performance skills became obvious to his parents early on, and after signing him up with a talent agent who wanted Leonardo to perform under the stage name &quot;Lenny Williams&quot;, DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational programs. DiCaprio began attracting the attention of producers, who cast him in bit part roles in a number of television series, such as _&quot;Roseanne&quot; (1988)_ (qv) and _&quot;The New Lassie&quot; (1989)_ (qv), but it wasn&apos;t until 1991 that DiCaprio made his film debut in _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv), a low-budget horror movie.  While _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv) did little to help showcase DiCaprio&apos;s acting abilities, it did help him develop his show-reel, and attract the attention of the people behind the hit sitcom _&quot;Growing Pains&quot; (1985)_ (qv), in which Leonardo was cast in the &quot;Cousin Oliver&quot; role of a young homeless boy who moves in with the Seavers. While DiCaprio&apos;s stint on _&quot;Growing Pains&quot; (1985)_ (qv) was very short, as the sitcom was axed the year after he joined, it helped bring DiCaprio into the public&apos;s attention and, after the show ended, DiCaprio began auditioning for roles in which he would get the chance to prove his acting chops. Leonardo took up a diverse range of roles in the early 1990s, including a mentally challenged youth in _What&apos;s Eating Gilbert Grape (1993)_ (qv), a young gunslinger in _The Quick and the Dead (1995)_ (qv) and a drug addict in one of his most challenging roles to date, &quot;Jim Carroll&quot;, in _The Basketball Diaries (1995)_ (qv), a role which the late &apos;River Phoenix&apos; (qv) originally expressed interest in.  While these diverse roles helped establish Leonardo&apos;s reputation as an actor, it wasn&apos;t until his role as &quot;Romeo&quot; in &apos;Baz Luhrmann&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Romeo + Juliet (1996)_ (qv) that Leonardo became a household name, a true movie star. The following year, DiCaprio starred in another movie about doomed lovers, _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), which went on to beat all box office records held before then, as, at the time, _Titanic (1997)_ (qv) became the highest grossing movie of all time, and cemented DiCaprio&apos;s reputation as a teen heartthrob.  Following his work on _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), DiCaprio kept a low profile for a number of years, with roles in _The Man in the Iron Mask (1998/I)_ (qv) and the low-budget _The Beach (2000/I)_ (qv) being some of his few notable roles during this period. However, in 2002, he burst back into screens throughout the world with leading roles in _Catch Me If You Can (2002)_ (qv) and _Gangs of New York (2002)_ (qv), his first of many collaborations with director &apos;Martin Scorsese&apos; (qv).  With a current salary of $20 million a movie, DiCaprio is now one of the biggest movie stars in the world. However, he has not limited his professional career to just acting in movies, as DiCaprio is a committed environmentalist, who is actively involved in many environmental causes, and his commitment to this issue led to his involvement in The 11th Hour, a documentary movie about the state of the natural environment.  As someone who has gone from bit parts in television commercials to one of the most respected actors in the world, DiCaprio has had one of the most diverse careers in cinema. DiCaprio continues to defy conventions about the types of roles he will accept, and with his career now seeing him leading all star casts in action thrillers such as _The Departed (2006)_ (qv), _Shutter Island (2010)_ (qv) and &apos;Christopher Nolan (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Inception (2010)_ (qv), DiCaprio continues to wow audiences by refusing to conform to any cliché about actors. DiCaprio is not merely a former teen heartthrob turned leading man, he is one of the most respected, daring and challenging actors working today.</biography>

      <birthName>Cleese, John Marwood</birthName>
      <biography>John Cleese was born on October 27, 1939, in Weston-Super-Mare, England. He was born into a family of modest means, his father being an insurance salesman; but he was nonetheless sent off to private schools to obtain a good education. Here he was often tormented for his height, having reached a height of six feet by the age of twelve, and eventually discovered that being humorous could deflect aggressive behavior in others. He loved humor in and of itself, collected jokes, and, like many young Britons who would grow up to be comedians, was devoted to the radio comedy show, &quot;The Goon Show,&quot; starring the legendary &apos;Peter Sellers (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Spike Milligan&apos; (qv), and &apos;Harry Secombe&apos; (qv).  Cleese did well in both sports and academics, but his real love was comedy. He attended Cambridge to read (study) Law, but devoted a great deal of time to the university&apos;s legendary Footlights group, writing and performing in comedy reviews, often in collaboration with future fellow Python &apos;Graham Chapman&apos; (qv). Several of these comedy reviews met with great success, including one in particular which toured under the name &quot;Cambridge Circus.&quot; When Cleese graduated, he went on to write for the BBC, then rejoined Cambridge Circus in 1964, which toured New Zealand and America. He remained in America after leaving Cambridge Circus, performing and doing a little journalism, and here met &apos;Terry Gilliam&apos; (qv), another future Python.  Returning to England, he began appearing in a BBC radio series, &quot;I&apos;m Sorry, I&apos;ll Read That Again&quot;, based on Cambridge Circus. It ran for several years and also starred future Goodies &apos;Tim Brooke-Taylor&apos; (qv), &apos;Bill Oddie&apos; (qv) and &apos;Graeme Garden&apos; (qv). He also appeared, briefly, with Brooke-Taylor, &apos;Graham Chapman&apos; (qv) and &apos;Marty Feldman&apos; (qv) in _&quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot; (1967)_ (qv), for television, and a series of collaborations with some of the finest comedy-writing talent in England at the time, some of whom - &apos;Eric Idle&apos; (qv), &apos;Terry Gilliam&apos; (qv), &apos;Terry Jones (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Michael Palin&apos; (qv), and Chapman - eventually joined him in Monty Python. These programs included _&quot;The Frost Report&quot; (1966)_ (qv) and &apos;Marty Feldman&apos; (qv)&apos;s program _&quot;Marty&quot; (1968)_ (qv). Eventually, however, the writers were themselves collected to be the talent for their own program, _&quot;Monty Python&apos;s Flying Circus&quot; (1969)_ (qv), which displayed a strange and completely absorbing blend of low farce and high-concept absurdist humor, and remains influential to this day.  After three seasons of the intensity of Monty Python, Cleese left the show, though he collaborated with one or more of the other Pythons for decades to come, including the Python movies released in the mid-70s to early 80s - _Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975)_ (qv), _Life of Brian (1979)_ (qv), _Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl (1982)_ (qv), and _The Meaning of Life (1983)_ (qv). Cleese and then-wife &apos;Connie Booth (I)&apos; (qv) collaborated in the legendary television series _&quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; (1975)_ (qv), as the sharp-tongued, rude, bumbling yet somehow lovable proprietor of an English seaside hotel. Cleese based this character on a proprietor he had met while staying with the other Pythons at a hotel in Torquay, England. Only a dozen episodes were made, but each is truly hilarious, and he is still closely associated with the program to this day.  Meanwhile Cleese had established a production company, Video Arts, for clever business training videos in which he generally starred, which were and continue to be enormously successful in the English-speaking world. He continues to act prolifically in movies, including in the hit comedy _A Fish Called Wanda (1988)_ (qv), in the Harry Potter series, and in the James Bond series as the new Q, starting with _The World Is Not Enough (1999)_ (qv), in which he began as R before graduating to Q. Cleese also supplies his voice to numerous animated and video projects, and frequently does commercials.  Besides the infamous Basil Fawlty character, Cleese&apos;s other well-known trademark is his rendition of an English upper-class toff. He has a daughter with &apos;Connie Booth (I)&apos; (qv) and a daughter with his second wife, &apos;Barbara Trentham&apos; (qv). As of January 19, 2008, he became embroiled in divorce proceedings with third wife (of nineteen years) &apos;Alyce Faye Eichelberger&apos; (qv).  Education and learning are important elements of his life - he was Rector of the University of Saint Andrews from 1973 until 1976, and continues to be a professor-at-large of Cornell University in New York. Cleese lives in Santa Barbara, California.</biography>

Still unsure of his ultimate vocation, he worked various jobs on the crew.  The role as Abel in John Houston&apos;s film &quot;The Bible&quot; marked a crucial point in his career.  A few months later he had his big break with the internationally acclaimed cult-classic Spaghetti-Western &quot;Django&quot;. The following year Joshua Logan cast him in the film version of &quot;Camelot&quot; (Warner Bros.), opposite Vanessa Redgrave, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe award.

In the USA he has been in successful mini-series such as &quot;The Pirate&quot; (Warner Bros), &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; (CBS), &quot;Young Catherine&quot; (TNT), &quot;Bella Mafia&quot; (CBS), &quot;The Painted Lady&quot;, &quot;Saint Augustine&quot;, and movies such as &quot;The Legend of Valentino&quot;, &quot;21 Hours to Munich&quot;, &quot;Force 10 from Navarone&quot;, &quot;Enter the Ninja&quot;, &quot;The Versace Murder&quot;, &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;, and recently &quot;Letters to Juliet&quot;.  At the beginning of the 80&apos;s, he also began producing, writing and directing.  Between films, he participates in various theatrical events.  Over the last 45 years he has been a benefactor of the Don Bosco orphanage in Tivoli.  He has received many awards and in 1992 for his artistic merits a knighthood of the Italian Republic was bestowed on him by the President of Italy.

      <biography>Julia Fiona Roberts, born in Smyrna, Georgia, never dreamed she would become the most popular actress in America. As a child, due to her love of animals, Julia originally wanted to be a veterinarian, but later studied journalism. When her brother, &apos;Eric Roberts (I)&apos; (qv), achieved some success in Hollywood, Julia decided to try acting. Her first break came in 1988 when she appeared in two youth-oriented movies _Mystic Pizza (1988)_ (qv) and _Satisfaction (1988)_ (qv). The movies introduced her to a new audience who instantly fell in love with this pretty woman. Julia&apos;s biggest success was in the signature movie _Pretty Woman (1990)_ (qv), for which Julia got an Oscar nomination, and also won the People&apos;s Choice award for Favorite Actress. Even though Julia would spend the next few years either starring in serious movies, or playing fantasy roles like Tinkerbell, the movie audiences would always love Julia best in romantic comedies. With _My Best Friend&apos;s Wedding (1997)_ (qv) Julia gave the genre fresh life that had been lacking in Hollywood for some time. Offscreen, after a brief marriage, Julia has been romantically linked with several other actors. Julia has also become involved with UNICEF charities and has made visits to many different countries, including Haiti and India, in order to promote goodwill. Julia is one of the most popular and sought-after talents in Hollywood.</biography>

Her father, Nessim Garmezano, was a tailor, from Sicily, who changed his last name when he arrived in the United States. Gorme began singing straight out of high school, with various big bands. But her big break came after she auditioned for, and joined, &quot;The _&quot;Tonight!&quot; (1953)_ (qv) Show&quot; in 1953. There, for $90 a week, she sang solos and sang duets with the up-and-coming &apos;Steve Lawrence (I)&apos; (qv). The two performed on the show for five years, and married in 1957. After their &quot;Tonight Show&quot; stint, the pair had a short-lived TV show of their own, _&quot;The Steve Lawrence-Eydie Gorme Show&quot; (1958)_ (qv). Then, Lawrence entered the Army leaving Gorme, a new mother, to frequent the night club circuit on her own. Two years later, when Lawrence was discharged, the couple came to a decision to enter show business more professionally. Their career took off, with audiences drawn to their penchant for the classics in favor of rock &apos;n&apos; roll, as well as their spontaneous banter.</biography>

      <biography>Javier Bardem is the youngest member of a family of actors that has been making films since the early days of Spanish cinema. He got his start in the family business, at age six, when he appeared in his first feature, &quot;El picaro&quot; (1974) (A.K.A. The Scoundrel). During his teenage years, he acted in several TV series, played rugby for the Spanish National Team, and toured the country with an independent theatrical group. Javier&apos;s early film role as a sexy stud in the black comedy, _Jamón Jamón (1992)_ (qv) (aka Ham Ham) propelled him to instant popularity and threatened to typecast him as nothing more than a brawny sex symbol. Determined to avert a beefcake image, he refused similar subsequent roles and has gone on to win acclaim for his ability to appear almost unrecognizable from film to film. With over 25 movies and numerous awards under his belt, it is Javier&apos;s stirring, passionate performance as the persecuted Cuban writer, &apos;Reynaldo Arenas (I)&apos; (qv), in _Before Night Falls (2000)_ (qv) that will long be remembered as his breakthrough role. He received five Best Actor awards and a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his portrayal.</biography>

His father was an officer at the D-Day landings in Normandy, and after the war he was summoned to Buckingham Palace where he received the Distinguished Service Cross medal from King George VI in person. After graduating from the University of Salford in England with a Bachelors degree, Paul took a trip to California. He liked it so much that he stayed. He applied to be an officer in the U.S Marines and passed all the tests except for the one for his eyesight. Very disappointed, he moved on to other things, including acting. Because of his military look and hair style (high &apos;n&apos; tight) he has been cast in many military roles as a background actor, most recently as a 4-star U.S. Air Force General in a Disney Production. He recently graduated with a Masters degree in Communication from Hawaii Pacific University and can now concentrate on gaining more acting work.</biography>

      <biography>Muscular, swaggering and tough, Scott Caan gives every indication of becoming a &quot;man&apos;s-man&quot; like his father, legendary actor &apos;James Caan (I)&apos; (qv). While it is obvious that he admires tough method actors like &apos;Marlon Brando&apos; (qv) and &apos;Sean Penn (I)&apos; (qv), Scott also has a strong egalitarian streak, evidenced by his reasoning for baring his body in films. He is quoted as saying that originally only the women in the scene were to be nude, but that he felt it really sexist, so he stripped too.  Scott was born on August 23, 1976 in Los Angeles, California. He spent his childhood being shuttled between his parent&apos;s homes. His mom is actress and model &apos;Sheila Ryan (II)&apos; (qv); the Caans divorced when Scott was a year old. He has an older half-sister, Tara, and three younger half-brothers: Alexander, Jacob, and James.  Self-desribed as a bad kid who was always getting into trouble, Scott initially steered clear of acting, opting to play sports instead. Scott benefited from his father&apos;s hands-on approach to child rearing; the elder Caan reportedly took a five-year hiatus to coach all of his son&apos;s little league teams. He also pursued his love of hip-hop by forming a group with his friend &apos;The Alchemist&apos; (qv); as The Whooliganz, the duo made inroads on the music scene and signed an ill-fated contract with Tommy Boy Records.  It did not take long for Scott to appear in front of the camera; in 1995, he took roles in a couple independent films, _Aaron Gillespie Will Make You a Star (1995)_ (qv) and _A Boy Called Hate (1995)_ (qv). Critical of his performances, Scott enrolled at Playhouse West in Los Angeles to study acting. Roles in more indies followed, including _Bongwater (1997)_ (qv) and &apos;Gregg Araki&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Nowhere (1997)_ (qv).  His first major film was also a hit; he had a supporting role in _Enemy of the State (1998)_ (qv) for director &apos;Tony Scott (I)&apos; (qv). He then appeared (in the buff) in _Varsity Blues (1999)_ (qv) as a wisecracking receiver. By now, Scott had built a reliable reputation for playing strong-minded characters with a sense of humor, exemplified by his work in movies such a _Boiler Room (2000)_ (qv), _Ready to Rumble (2000)_ (qv), and his second hit picture, _Gone in Sixty Seconds (2000)_ (qv).  Scott&apos;s star rose with a fun supporting turn in &apos;Steven Soderbergh&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Ocean&apos;s Eleven (2001)_ (qv) remake. At this time he had more indie turns in the films _American Outlaws (2001)_ (qv), _Novocaine (2001)_ (qv), and _Sonny (2002)_ (qv) - &apos;Nicolas Cage&apos; (qv)&apos;s directorial debut starring &apos;James Franco&apos; (qv). Scott followed up with his own directorial outing, _Dallas 362 (2003)_ (qv).  Scott reprised his role as Turk Malloy in _Ocean&apos;s Twelve (2004)_ (qv), then took a supporting roles in two very different pictures: the sexy, ocean-bound thriller _Into the Blue (2005)_ (qv) and in &apos;Nicole Holofcener&apos; (qv)&apos;s indie comedy, _Friends with Money (2006)_ (qv). 2006 marked Caan&apos;s return to the director¹s chair, with _The Dog Problem (2006)_ (qv), and soon was back for _Ocean&apos;s Thirteen (2007)_ (qv).  Over the past few years, Scott made memorable appearances as a recurring character on _&quot;Entourage&quot; (2004)_ (qv). Currently, he has a starring role in the remake of the TV series _&quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; (2010)_ (qv).  Scott has also established himself as a photographer, having been mentored in the medium by cinematographer &apos;Phil Parmet&apos; (qv). In 2009, he published his book, Scott Caan Photographs, Vol. 1.</biography>

      <biography>He&apos;s the son of Vaudeville great, &apos;Clarence Stroud&apos; (qv), of the Stroud Twins and singer &apos;Ann McCormack (I)&apos; (qv), who toured the world with &apos;Frank Sinatra&apos; (qv).  Don grew up on the beach in Honolulu, Hawaii, where his stepfather, &apos;Paul Livermore&apos; (qv), and his mother, Ann, owned and operated the popular &quot;Embers Steak House&quot; and nightclub where Ann performed nightly. Don thrived on the beach in Waikiki under the watchful eyes of such mentors as Blackout, Mud, Buckshot, Rabbit and Steamboat. He learned much from these famous beach boys and in 1960, at the age of 17, he placed fourth in the &quot;Duke Kahanamoku World Surfing Championship&quot; at Makaha, Hawaii. Don was surfing at Waikiki when he was discovered. Actor &apos;Troy Donahue&apos; (qv) was filming _&quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; (1959)_ (qv) and needed a stunt double for his surfing scenes. Don, at 18, 6&apos; 2&quot; and 175 pounds, stepped up and was hired on the spot. He loved the gig so much, he decided to go to Hollywood to give it a try. Upon arriving in L.A., he landed a variety of jobs, including parking cars, bouncer and then manager of the world famous &quot;Whiskey A Go-Go&quot; nightclub on the Sunset Strip, where such greats as &apos;Janis Joplin&apos; (qv), &apos;Jimi Hendrix&apos; (qv) and &apos;Jim Morrison (I)&apos; (qv) of the &quot;Doors&quot; appeared. It was at the &quot;Whiskey&quot; that actor &apos;Sidney Poitier&apos; (qv) turned Don on to his acting career. Don went on to become one of Hollywood&apos;s great heavies and character actors. He has starred in over 100 movies and 175 television shows to date. He has also starred in four television series, notably &apos;Mickey Spillane&apos; (qv)&apos;s _&quot;Mike Hammer&quot; (1984)_ (qv) with &apos;Stacy Keach&apos; (qv) and _&quot;The New Gidget&quot; (1986)_ (qv) where he was a natural to play the &quot;Kahuna&quot;.</biography>

      <birthName>Winfrey, Orpah Gail</birthName>
      <biography>Born Orpah Gail Winfrey in Kosciusko, Mississippi, United States. Orpah was born to mother, former maid Vernita Lee, and father, war veteran Vermon Winfrey. Oprah Gail Winfrey was the richest African American of the 20th century, however Orpah Gail Winfrey wasn&apos;t born into a rich, or even middle class family. Orpah Gail Winfrey was born in an economically troubled neighborhood and raised by a single-teenaged mother in the city of Milwaukee. Orpah, named after a biblical character, had a name no one could pronounce, so her family and friends starting calling her Oprah. Shortly after Oprah&apos;s birth, Vernita Lee left her daughter and traveled north. Oprah was then raised by her grandmother,Hatti Mae Lee. Oprah while being raised by her grandmother lived in terrible conditions. Oprah&apos;s only friends were farm animals,however even at that age Oprah had a very imaginative mind. Oprah would frequently give the animals dramatic parts and included them in games. This was perhaps where she had gotten the craze for acting, and would soon be seen in legendary masterpieces such as The Color Purple. Oprah because of her grandmother&apos;s values, had religion and God instilled in herself at a very young age. Oprah because of her grandmother knew how to read,and write before the age of three. Oprah during church would recite poems,and verses from the bible. Soon the church, and the entire neighborhood knew she had a gift and was nicknamed,&quot;The Little Speaker&quot;. This would soon prompt her to become a woman with a strong perspective, which millions across the world would want to have insight on. This prepared her for The Oprah Winfrey Show.  Due to her ability to read and write before the age of three, when enrolled in school she was often promoted several grades ahead of her age. Oprah at the age of six went to live with her mother, Vernita Lee. Vernita worked as a maid, so Oprah was often left alone at home with her cousins. Oprah due to her busy mother was paid little attention to at home, this is what prompted Oprah to started misbehaving and talking back to her mother. Vernita Lee then decided it was best Oprah live with her father in Nashville Tennessee. Oprah while living in Tennessee, found out her mother was pregnant and her mother requested for her to come back to Milwaukee to live with her mother and half-sister. When Oprah was nine she was raped by her nineteen year old cousin who was baby sitting her. This wouldn&apos;t be the only time she was sexually abused she would then be sexually abused by her cousin, a family friend,her mother&apos;s boyfriend, and her uncle during her stay in Milwaukee. Toward all these incidents, she never told a soul because the predators swore her to silence. At the age of thirteen Oprah ran away from home, this was due to her years of abuse and at the age of fourteen she became pregnant with an ill son who died shortly after birth.

Oprah during the last year of high-school was rehearsing with her drama class when a local radio station, WVOL spotted her and asked her if she would like to read on radio. Oprah was then given a job reading the news on the radio. Oprah soon entered into a public speaking contest where the grand prize was a scholarship to Tennessee State University. Oprah won the contest and received a scholarship to Tennessee State University where she majored in Speech Communications and Performing Arts.  Oprah during her college education was offered a job as a co-anchor on the CBS television station, she declined several times before she was convinced by her speech professor that it may be the ultimate step to launch her career. Oprah wanted to find work outside of Nashville Tennessee and was soon offered a job in Baltimore,Maryland. The job offer came up a few months before her graduation, she had to choose between the job and graduating, so she decided to choose the job in Maryland as the offer was very tempting. At the job in Maryland she wasn&apos;t a very good reporter and was shortly fired. Oprah&apos;s boss set her up as a talk show host on a morning talk show called, &quot;People Are Talking&quot;. Immediately after the first show Oprah new this is what she wanted to do for the rest of her life. Oprah strengthened the talk show for seven years and then she decided it was time to move on.

At the age of 18 Tatiana left her homeland to pursue her career as an actress in the big city, MOSCOW. With nothing but Stanislavsky&apos;s words in her mind &apos;Have faith in ALL&apos;. Life had changed and was very far from easy but Tatiana managed to win her place at one of the most credited Moscow Theatrical Academy&apos;s of Performing Arts - RATI obtaining the Red Diploma in Professional Acting for Film, TV and Theatre. She then went on to work in the Moscow Film Industry as well as working in Georgia at the famous Russian-Georgian Culture Drama Theatre - Griboyedov.  Tatiana successfully established her name within the Russian Film Industry, from 1980-1992 completing 5 Feature Films, 10 TV Dramas, 12 Theatre productions (including classical, modern dramas, comedies and musicals), she then went onto write her first film movie script &apos;In The Shadow of Thy Wings Cover Me&apos;, a sensational story of love, loss and misfortune, that had one 1st prize at the international Aids Convention. Ironically came an unexpected betrayal and fall in Tatiana&apos;s career once the script came into production and dramatically changed her working position in Moscow.  This had discouraged Tatiana and had prompted the move London in 1992 to continue her acting career in the UK. More recently Tatiana had appeared in many cameo - character roles in various Film and TV productions in the UK and has worked with the likes of David Cronenberg, Mike Leigh and Otto Bathurst. In between Tatiana has travelled back to Russia to work on the new Alexander Brunkovski film &apos;Unseen Life&apos;, which proved to be a great success.  More recently Tatiana has been featured in Mark Foster&apos;s &apos;World War Z&apos;, playing the part of a Russian Lady alongside Brad Pitt in a very dramatically driven and emotionally evoking episode.</biography>

      <biography>Carl Reiner is a legend of American comedy, having achieved great success as a comic actor, a director, producer and recording artist. He has won nine Emmy Awards, three as an actor, three as a writer and two as a producer. He also won a Grammy Award for his &quot;10,000 Year Old Man&quot; album, based on his comedy routine with &apos;Mel Brooks (I)&apos; (qv).  Reiner was born in The Bronx. His father Irving, a Romanian immigrant, was a watchmaker; his mother, Bessie (née Mathias), had been born in Austria. At the age of 16, while working as a sewing machine repairman, he attended a dramatic workshop sponsored by the Works Progress Administration. The direction of his life was set.  In the 1970s, some sources claimed that Reiner made his movie debut in _New Faces of 1937 (1937)_ (qv), but that is unlikely as he would have only been 15-years-old at the time. (Interesting, that movie shares the same plot as his erstwhile partner &apos;Mel Brooks (I)&apos; (qv)&apos; 1968 classic, _The Producers (1967)_ (qv), with a crooked producer planning to fleece his &quot;angels&quot; by producing a flop and absconding with the money). He didn&apos;t appear on screen, silver or small, until he made his TV debut in 1948 in the short-lived TV series, _&quot;The Fashion Story&quot; (1948)_ (qv), then became a regular, the following year, on _&quot;The Fifty-Fourth Street Revue&quot; (1949), another TV series with a brief life.  Reiner made his Broadway debut in 1949 in the musical &quot;Inside U.S.A.&quot;, a hit that ran for 399 performances. His next Broadway show, the 1950 musical revue, &quot;Alive and Kicking&quot;, was a flop, lasting just 43 performances. &apos;Max Liebman&apos; (qv), the producer/director/writer/composer, had been called in to provide additional material after the show&apos;s troubled six week out-of-town preview in Boston. It didn&apos;t help -- the show closed after six weeks on Broadway -- but an important contact had been made.  Leibman was a producer-director on _&quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; (1950)_ (qv), one of the great TV series, and he hired Reiner to appear on the show in the middle of its first season. Reiner&apos;s first gig on the revue-like show was interviewing &quot;The Professor&quot;, a character played by &apos;Sid Caesar&apos; (qv). He became central to the comedy portions of the show and, in 1953, he racked up the first of six Emmy nominations for acting. (In all, he was nominated for an Emmy Award a total of 13 times). When, in 1954, &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; was split up by the network into its constituent parts, Reiner continued on with Sid in _&quot;Caesar&apos;s Hour&quot; (1954)_ (qv). (&apos;Imogene Coca&apos; (qv) was given her own show, which lasted one season, and Leibman was allowed to produced specials).  &quot;Your Show or Shows&quot; had been a Broadway-style revue, featuring skits such as dancing (including a young &apos;Bob Fosse&apos; (qv)) whereas &quot;Caesar&apos;s Hour&quot; was pure comedy. &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; had had a great cast, another other than Coca, most of the cast, including Reiner, &apos;Howard Morris (I)&apos; (qv), and &apos;Nanette Fabray&apos; (qv) (who went on to win an Emmy) moved over to &quot;Caesar&apos;s Hour&quot;. In his three seasons on the show, he was nominated three more times for a Best Supporting Actor Emmy, winning twice in 1957 and 1958. But it was its stable of comedy writers that was essential to the great success of both &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; and &quot;Caesar&apos;s Hour&quot;. In addition to &apos;Mel Brooks (I)&apos; (qv), the writing staff included &apos;Neil Simon (I)&apos; (qv), his brother &apos;Danny Simon (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Larry Gelbart&apos; (qv) and &apos;Mel Tolkin&apos; (qv). (There are rumors that the young &apos;Woody Allen&apos; (qv) served as the writing staff&apos;s typist).  Reiner had sat in informally with the writers during &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;, but he began writing formally for &quot;Caesar&apos;s Hour&quot;, having learned his craft from all of the other writers. As a self-described uncredited &quot;writer without portfolio&quot;, he was able to leave writers&apos; meetings at 6 PM, if he wanted to. This gave him the time to work on a semi-autobiographical novel. Published in 1958, _Enter Laughing (1967)_ (qv) is about a young man in 1930s New York trying to make it in show business. It was transformed into a play and, eventually, adapted into a movie in 1967, and a musical, many years later.  In 1959, he created the pilot for a TV series, &quot;Man of the House&quot;, in which he would play a writer, &quot;Rob Petrie&quot;, who balanced his family life with the demands of working as a writer for a comedy show headlined by an egotistical comedic genius modeled after &apos;Sid Caesar&apos; (qv) (a &quot;benign despot&quot; who lacked social skills, according to Reiner). The series was rooted in his experience on &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; and &quot;Caesar&apos;s Hour&quot;. The network didn&apos;t pick up the pilot at first, as CBS executives claimed the main character, which was clearly autobiographical on Reiner&apos;s part, was too New York, too Jewish and too intellectual. In 1960, Reiner teamed up with &apos;Mel Brooks (I)&apos; (qv) on _&quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; (1956)_ (qv), and their routine &quot;The 2000 Year Old Man&quot; was a huge success. Reiner played the straight man to Brooks in the routine, which was spun-off into five comedy albums, bringing them a Grammy Award. They also made an animated TV special based on their shtick in 1975.  Though CBS turned down &quot;Man of the House&quot;, with the two-time Emmy-winning comedian Reiner as the lead, it was still interested in the series. However, they wanted a WASP in the role of &quot;Rob Petrie&quot; to ensure the broad appeal of the show, and the casting of the protagonist came down to &apos;Johnny Carson (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Dick Van Dyke&apos; (qv). Carson was a game show host of no great note at the time, but Van Dyke was in the smash Broadway musical, _Bye Bye Birdie (1963)_ (qv), for which he won a Tony Award. He got the part and another chapter of TV history was made, when &apos;Mary Tyler Moore&apos; (qv), &apos;Rose Marie (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Morey Amsterdam&apos; (qv) all were cast in leading roles. Reiner, himself, would eventually play the role of &quot;Alan Brady&quot;, the abrasive &apos;Sid Caesar&apos; (qv)-like comic convinced of his own genius, in the last few seasons of the series&apos; five-year run.  Another milestone in TV comedy, _&quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; (1961)_ (qv), brought Reiner five more Emmies, three for writing and two as the producer of the series. In 1966, Reiner and the other principals, including executive producer &apos;Sheldon Leonard&apos; (qv) and Dick Van Dyke, decided to end the series at the height of its popularity and critical acclaim. (The show won Emmies as best show and best comedy in 1965 and 1966, respectively). Twenty-nine years after the show was ended, Reiner reprised the role of &quot;Alan Brady&quot; on _&quot;Mad About You&quot; (1992)_ (qv), winning his eighth (and so far, last) Emmy Award, this time as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.  It was on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; that Reiner first became a director. His feature film debut, as a director, was with the film adaptation of the play &apos;Joseph Stein&apos; (qv) had adapted from his 1958 novel, _Enter Laughing (1967)_ (qv). His work as a writer-director, with &apos;Dick Van Dyke&apos; (qv), in creating a &apos;Stan Laurel&apos; (qv)-type character in _The Comic (1969)_ (qv) was not a success, but _Where&apos;s Poppa? (1970)_ (qv) became a cult classic and _Oh, God! (1977)_ (qv), with &apos;George Burns (I)&apos; (qv), and _The Jerk (1979)_ (qv), with &apos;Steve Martin (I)&apos; (qv), were smash hits. The last movie he directed was the 1997 comedy, _That Old Feeling (1997)_ (qv).  Reiner&apos;s career has continued on into the 21st Century, when most of his contemporaries had retired. He was awarded the &apos;Mark Twain&apos; (qv) Prize for American Humor in 2000 and, starting in 2001, he acted in the remake of _Ocean&apos;s Eleven (2001)_ (qv) and its two sequels. Most recently, he has appeared as a voice artist in the animated series, _&quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; (2009)_ (qv) (he even wrote an episode for the series rooted in his &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; experience) and has appeared as a regular on the TV series, _&quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; (2010)_ (qv) (with fellow nonagenarian &apos;Betty White (I)&apos; (qv)), as well as appeared on an episode of _&quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; (2009)_ (qv) in 2012.</biography>

They were reunited with their mother after the war, but the family was destitute, and ostracised by other Germans for their father&apos;s treachery. She ended up studying textile design in Florence, where a fashion designer first asked her to model. She had first travelled to New York in 1961 as plain old Vera, but failed to secure a single booking. After retreating to Milan for a spell, she returned to take Manhattan under her new name....

      <biography>Ten years before Czechoslovakia separated, Vlastina was born to Czechoslovakian parents: a Slovak mother and Czech (or shall we say, Moravian) father. She attended elementary and a high school in the Slovak town of Myjava. She studied piano for fifteen years and also took in drawings and singing lessons. She also studied writing and reciting poems. Even though Vlastina had wanted become an actress since childhood, she made two detours along the way. She studied Mass Communication as well as the Commenius University in Bratislava, where she got her Master. Her first feature was Casino Royale by Martin Campbell, where she got a part in the casino. Then she continued in The Red Baron, Dark Spirits, Women in Temptation. She got a role of an American spy in television film The Rhythm at their heels. A story set in the early 1950s, when the communist regime in Czechoslovakia mercilessly wiped out the remaining elements of the free world. A bunch of naive young people associated with a coffee-house jazz band were easy prey for the pitiless State Security men. In 2009 she got a part of a nurse Tereza in thriller Unknown Hour - a not very fictive story of a man, known in fact as &quot;the hospital murderer&quot;. In 2010 she started to shoot a historical epic The Danube Saga where she performed the main character of Elena Unger. Saga, a concatenation of stories of one&apos;s line. Vlastina is also performing in theater and writing books.</biography>

      <biography>A Manhattan-born character player who attended New York University, actor James Russo wrote and starred in a prize-winning short film, &quot;The Candy Store&quot;, while attending college. His first big film break was as a convenience store robber in _Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982)_ (qv). Possessed with a stare that can bring shivers down one&apos;s back, he has been quite the accessible villain over the years, memorably portraying a number of gritty psychopaths and gangsters, among other undesirables. Surprisingly, Russo is not a name or commodity, yet an intense and dependable &quot;tough guy&quot; performer he has proven to be. One only needs to be reminded of his sadistic sexual animal role in &quot;Extremities&quot; on stage (in which he won a 1983 Theatre World) and in film (in which he terrorized &apos;Farrah Fawcett&apos; (qv)), to recall how chillingly effective he can be. Other decent roles in films include &apos;Kevin Costner&apos; (qv)&apos;s _The Postman (1997)_ (qv) and _Open Range (2003)_ (qv), plus _Beverly Hills Cop (1984)_ (qv), _We&apos;re No Angels (1989)_ (qv), _Donnie Brasco (1997)_ (qv), _No Way Home (1996)_ (qv), and a number of low-budget crimers. On stage, he has &quot;Welcome to Andromeda&quot;, &quot;Deathwatch&quot;, &quot;Marat/Sade&quot; and the afore-mentioned &quot;Extremities&quot; to his credit. Russo appeared opposite &apos;Johnny Depp&apos; (qv) in &apos;Roman Polanski&apos; (qv)&apos;s _The Ninth Gate (1999)_ (qv), and portrayed mobster &quot;Victor Mura&quot; in TV&apos;s short-lived, _&quot;Falcone&quot; (2000)_ (qv), the following year. More recently, he offered a penetrating cameo as &apos;Frank Sinatra&apos; (qv) in _Stealing Sinatra (2003)_ (qv).</biography>

Still in New York, Jared appeared in the off-Broadway play Ecstasy, for which he won an Obie Award in 1992.  In 1996, he won recognition by playing famous pop artist &apos;Andy Warhol&apos; (qv) in _I Shot Andy Warhol (1996)_ (qv).

      <biography>Daniel Edward Harland was born on the 11th January 1985 in Ipswich, Suffolk. He grew up in Durham in the North of England from the age of four and spent the majority of his life there. At school, he longed to be a professional footballer where he was handed a chance to join the Sunderland FC Youth Academy. He turned it down, and pursued a number of different aspirations which led to many dead ends. Without any idea where his life was going, his parents, who were both teachers at the time, decided to push him towards acting. He joined New College in Durham in 2002 and studied Performing Arts for three years. After graduating with top marks, he auditioned for many top drama schools such as RADA, Mountview and Guildford, without success. Daniel then took a year out working before finally being accepted into Bath Spa University, where he again studied Acting in 2007.  During his studies, he performed in stage productions such as A Streetcar Named Desire (2007, Faust (2009) and Beautiful Thing (2010) which toured many theatres around the South-East and London. After graduating in 2010, his Film and TV credits included Atonement (2007), The Runner (2008), The White Room (2009), Piggy (2011) and Dark Shadows (2012). He has also appeared in the new James Bond film, Skyfall (2012) and has a number of film projects lined up in the near future.  He also played the role of lead gangster, Terry in Britain&apos;s Biggest Heists Season Two (2010). He received critical acclaim for playing &apos;Jake&apos; in The Runner, who gets mixed up in the murky world of drugs and violence in the slums of Bristol.  He has also trained with Michael Hargreaves of RADA and Gunduz Kalic, founder of East 15 Acting School. He also continues to do a lot of work with the Actors Studio.</biography>

      <birthName>Broccoli, Barbara Dana</birthName>
      <biography>She is one of the entertainment industry&apos;s most successful female producers. Barbara Broccoli was born to legendary filmmaker &apos;Albert R. Broccoli&apos; (qv), affectionately known as Cubby, and &apos;Dana Broccoli&apos; (qv) on June 18, 1960. Not long after, Cubby Broccoli and his new partner, &apos;Harry Saltzman&apos; (qv), secured studio backing for an ambitious series of films inspired by the popular James Bond novels written by &apos;Ian Fleming (I)&apos; (qv).  Ms. Broccoli grew up in the behind-the-scenes world of James Bond, traveling with her family around the world to various exotic locations. As a child, she liked to play with the photocopy machines in the offices of Eon Productions, Ltd., her father&apos;s company responsible for the Bond films. During location shooting in Japan for _You Only Live Twice (1967)_ (qv), young Barbara caught a fever from the Japanese custom of sleeping on the floor. &apos;Sean Connery&apos; (qv), whose star status provided him with a comfortable bed, generously relinquished it so Barbara could properly fight her illness.  She graduated from Loyola University in Los Angeles, California with a degree in motion picture and television communications. Her first official credited job on the Bond films was for 1983&apos;s _Octopussy (1983)_ (qv) in which she served as an executive assistant. But, as with any family business, one helps out where one can. For instance, in her father&apos;s autobiography &quot;When The Snow Melts&quot;, she recalls a nightmarish situation involving _A View to a Kill (1985)_ (qv) star &apos;Grace Jones (I)&apos; (qv). Later, for the two &apos;Timothy Dalton&apos; (qv) Bond films, she was promoted to associate producer, a post she shared with veteran Bond associate producer &apos;Tom Pevsner&apos; (qv).  The August 8, 1990 issue of Variety (weekly) reported that aging Cubby Broccoli had turned control of Eon Productions Ltd. over to Barbara and her half-brother, &apos;Michael G. Wilson (I)&apos; (qv) (Dana&apos;s son, who had been an invaluable help to Cubby and the Bond franchise in various capacities since the mid-1970s). Due to some unfortunate business dealings with then-MGM ownership (the studio that bankrolled Bond and held significant interest in the series), production of the Bond films was put on what would become a six year hiatus.  When the litigation was settled, &quot;Bond 17&quot; (eventually named _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv)) was on track and Barbara Broccoli, now a full producer alongside &apos;Michael G. Wilson (I)&apos; (qv), was faced with the challenge of bringing Bond back to the big screen. She has earned a reputation as being tough when she has to be and for volunteering for the toughest jobs, such as overseeing the Russian location unit. _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv) was a world-wide smash, and each of the succeeding Bond films were also enormously popular. This is a testament to the talent of Cubby Broccoli, who passed his knowledge of high-stakes film production on to Michael and later Barbara. The benefit of Cubby&apos;s experience is obvious when viewing the newest Bond films starring &apos;Pierce Brosnan&apos; (qv).  Her non-Bond producing credits include _Crime of the Century (1996) (TV)_ (qv), which deals with the murder trial from the famous Lindberg kidnapping, and the popular London Stage production of &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, which was co-produced by her mother &apos;Dana Broccoli&apos; (qv) and half-brother &apos;Michael G. Wilson.&apos; Both productions carried a personal interest for Ms. Broccoli. Charles Lindberg was her father&apos;s favorite hero, and &quot;Chitty&quot; was adapted from the film produced by her father, which was based upon the children&apos;s novel by &apos;Ian Fleming (I)&apos; (qv).</biography>

Carl had seen him on a talk show, representing Nevada Highway Patrol, on the local PBS TV station and was impressed by his voice and screen presence. After appearing in dozens of local commercials, Scott landed the part of &quot;State Trooper&quot; on the WB TV series &quot;The Strip&quot;, his first SAG part, and later joked with Carl saying, &quot;If didn&apos;t get that part, I shouldn&apos;t be acting&quot;. He was catching the eyes of prominent Vegas casting directors, most notably, Ray Favaro and Merilee Lear and movie auditions began to come his way. Steven Soderbergh personally thanked Scott for making the Ocean&apos;s Eleven Airport Scene spectacular. As an honorably retired State Trooper, Scott gives law enforcement roles added realism and performs them flawlessly. He is sure, the best is yet to come!</biography>

      <birthName>Manoux, Jean-Paul Christophe</birthName>
      <biography>J.P. Manoux grew up on the beaches of Santa Barbara, California, the oldest of seven. He was involved in children&apos;s theatre productions and took tap dance lessons before attending the Thacher School in Ojai, California. Curiously, that tiny boarding school would provide no less than 3 doctors for NBC&apos;s long running hospital drama ER (Noah Wyle and Leland Orser, the other two). As college applications approached, Manoux&apos;s drama teacher recommended the undergraduate theatre department at Northwestern University.  Surrounded by Chicago&apos;s vibrant theatre scene, J.P. became passionate about improv and sketch comedy. Upon graduating and moving to Hollywood, he sharpened his own comedy chops at L.A. Theatresports, ACME Comedy Theatre, The Groundlings School, and I.O. West. Legit stage productions garnered critical accolades, culminating in 1999 with L.A. Ovation and Backstage West Garland Awards recognizing his work in the world premiere stage musical Reefer Madness.  Over the next few years, J.P. appeared in dozens of TV sitcoms and national commercials including campaigns for Got Milk? and Fruit of the Loom. He was a regular improviser and sketch player on ABC&apos;s 2001 prime-time variety experiment The Wayne Brady Show and he became a celebrity in the world of children&apos;s television thanks to his dual role as &quot;Mr. Hackett&quot; and &quot;Curtis the Caveman&quot; on the Disney Channel series Phil of the Future. During this period, he also voiced the lead role of &quot;Kuzco&quot; in Disney&apos;s animated series The Emperor&apos;s New School. In 2006, J.P. joined the ensemble of ER, recurring as surgical resident Dustin Crenshaw. It would prove to be a shrewd casting move, widely regarded (in the Manoux household) as the single most significant factor in returning the venerable series to its original acclaim, prestige, and sex appeal.  Opportunities to act and direct in Canada led Manoux to pursue immigration north of the border. The Toronto based productions of DisneyXD&apos;s sci-fi/adventure series Aaron Stone and Teletoon&apos;s hybrid animation comedy series Mud pit saw him working both in front of and behind the camera. Still a U.S. citizen, but now a permanent resident of Canada, Manoux routinely hops the border for film and television work, including his recurring role on Community as &quot;The Deanelganger&quot;. He hopes to continue spending summers in Toronto, acting in the new CTV multi-camera sitcom Spun Out which stars Dave Foley of The Kids in the Hall and Newsradio fame.  J.P. Manoux has appeared in over 30 feature films, 90 different television series, and 90 commercials. He has provided voice and motion capture performance for 8 video games, competed as a contestant or celebrity panelist on 6 gameshows, read 2 original pieces for All Things Condsidered on National Public Radio, co-written 1 play, and anonymously authored 1 biography.</biography>

      <biography>Derek was born in London and from an early age was fascinated with film and TV. He would regularly entertain friends and family with his impersonations of famous actors of the day. He attended a local theatre school later in his teens.  Derek was fortunate enough to meet the stage and screen actor Sir Nigel Hawthorne, who was a close neighbour and friend, and encouraged him to think about working within the acting profession and generously agreed to sponsor his application to join British Actor&apos;s Equity.  Derek worked on the first Star Wars film, &apos;A New Hope&apos; in 1976 - this was in fact his first job within the film business. He was chosen to appear as a Medal Bearer and Massassi Guard at the end of the film.  From this start, Derek has been able to cultivate his career in film, winning parts in many major films made in England, including, Flash Gordon, Krull, The Living Daylights, Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade plus many others. He has also worked on TV productions and was PC Craig Lovell in The Bill from 1987 to 1991. He has rubbed shoulders with many great actors, including Robert Mitchum, Julie Andrews, Jack Nicholson, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Sir Laurence Olivier, John Rhys-Davies and most recently Alec Baldwin. Derek was a close friend of the late Marvin Gaye, whilst the singer was recording his last album for Motown, `In Our Lifetime&apos;, in London.</biography>

      <biography>Olga Kurylenko, a Ukrainian-born actress and model, went from sharing a cramped flat with her aunt, uncle, grandparents and cousin to starring as a Bond girl opposite &apos;Daniel Craig (I)&apos; (qv).  She was born Olga Konstantinovna Kurylenko on November 14, 1979, in Berdyansk, Ukraine, Soviet Union. Her mother, Marina Alyabysheva, divorced her father, Konstantin Kurylenko, soon after her birth. After the divorce her mother struggled to survive as an art teacher. Young Olga was brought up by her mother and her grandmother, Raisa. During her youth Olga had the humbling experience of living in poverty; she had no choice but to wear rags and had to darn the holes on her sweater. During her years in Ukraine she studied art and languages and spent seven years studying piano at a local school of music in Berdyansk. She also went to a ballet studio until 13.  At age 13 Olga and her mother made a trip to Moscow. There she was spotted by an agent, who approached her at a subway station and offered her a job as a model. Initially Olga&apos;s mother was suspicious, but she checked the agent&apos;s credentials and eventually allowed Olga to accept training as a model in Moscow, which turned out to be a good career choice.  By age 16 she was ready for the next step. She moved to Paris, learned French in six months and was signed by the Madison agency. At age 18 she appeared on the cover of Glamour, and in short order graced the covers of Elle, Madame Figaro, Marie Claire, and Vogue. She also became the face of Lejaby lingerie, Bebe clothing, Clarins and Helena Rubinstein cosmetic companies.  In 1999 Olga married French photographer &apos;Cedric Van Mol&apos; (qv), but divorced him 3-1/2 years later. One day Olga presented herself to an acting agency. Eventually she swapped the catwalk for the movie screen, and her acting career took off. In 2005 she made her film debut as &quot;Iris&quot;, a sensual beauty, in _L&apos;annulaire (2005)_ (qv), by director &apos;Diane Bertrand&apos; (qv).  Olga&apos;s cinematic roles have been notably steamy, and her natural beauty and explicit nudity attracted the attention of the male audiences. She appeared opposite &apos;Elijah Wood&apos; (qv) in _Paris, je t&apos;aime (2006)_ (qv) and as &quot;Sofia&quot; in _Le serpent (2006)_ (qv), then co-starred as Russian beauty &quot;Nika Boronina&quot; opposite &apos;Timothy Olyphant (I)&apos; (qv) in _Hitman (2007/I)_ (qv). She also appeared as &quot;Mina Harud&quot; in the indie surveillance-thriller _&quot;Tyranny&quot; (2008)_ (qv). On Christmas Eve 2007, Olga was offered to play what will become her biggest hit: co-starring as &quot;Camille&quot;, the Bond girl, opposite &apos;Daniel Craig (I)&apos; (qv) in _Quantum of Solace (2008)_ (qv), a sequel to _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv).  With the international success as Bond Girl, Olga also made appearances on various TV productions in Russia and Ukraine. In 2012, Olga Kurylenko was cast as Julia, supporting role in the Sci-Fi adventure _Oblivion (2013/I)_ (qv) opposite &apos;Tom Cruse&apos; (qv) and &apos;Morgan Freeman (I)&apos; (qv).</biography>

      <birthName>Broccoli, Albert Romolo</birthName>
      <biography>Albert Romolo Broccoli was born in Astoria, Queens (New York City) on April 5th, 1909. His mother and father, Cristina and Giovanni Broccoli, raised young Albert in New York on the family farm. The family was in the vegetable business, and Albert claimed one of his uncles brought the first broccoli seeds into the United States in the 1870&apos;s. Albert&apos;s cousin &apos;Pat DiCicco&apos; (qv) gave him the nickname &quot;Cubby&quot; after a comic strip character named Kabibble. Cubby worked in a pharmacy and then as a coffin-maker, but a trip to see his cousin in Los Angeles gave him an ambition for film stardom. Pat was an actor&apos;s agent, and introduced Cubby to such stars as &apos;Randolph Scott (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Cary Grant (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Bob Hope (I)&apos; (qv).  In 1940, at the age of 31, Cubby married actress &apos;Gloria Blondell&apos; (qv). That same year the head of 20th Century-Fox offered him an assistant director position on _The Outlaw (1943)_ (qv), directed by &apos;Howard Hawks&apos; (qv) and produced by his good friend &apos;Howard Hughes (I)&apos; (qv). After this initial job opportunity Cubby became the top assistant director at Fox. He went on to serve as A.D. on such films as _The Song of Bernadette (1943)_ (qv) and _The Black Swan (1942)_ (qv). When World War II began, Cubby joined the U.S. Navy, where he met future film producer &apos;Ray Stark&apos; (qv), and together they become heads of entertainment for the troops. Cubby and Gloria decided to end their marriage in 1945, but remained good friends. After the war Cubby determined to get back into the movie business.  In 1946 his cousin Pat worked out the financing for a project called _Avalanche (1946)_ (qv), on which Cubby served as production manager. The film spawned a partnership between Cubby and director &apos;Irving Allen&apos; (qv). Broccoli and Allen later formed Warwick Productions, which eventually became a very successful independent production company based in London, England. After the poor response to &quot;Avalanche&quot;, however, Broccoli worked various odd jobs, including selling Christmas trees in California, and eventually took a job as a talent agent, where he represented, among others, &apos;Robert Wagner (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Lana Turner&apos; (qv).  In 1951 Cubby married Nedra Clark. That same year he left the talent agency and, together with his partner Allen, reformed Warwick to make _The Red Beret (1953)_ (qv). The film, released in the US as &quot;Paratrooper&quot;, was very profitable. Broccoli and Allen become the most successful independent producers in England, turning out such hits as _Safari (1956)_ (qv), _Zarak (1956)_ (qv) and _The Bandit of Zhobe (1959)_ (qv). Cubby and Nedra wanted to start a family but, according to the doctor, Nedra was unable to become pregnant. They instead adopted a young baby boy named Tony. Shortly afterwards Nedra became pregnant after all, and gave birth to a girl, whom they named Tina. Unfortunately, Nedra died in New York shortly afterwards. Cubby was now a widower with two children to raise. He spent months trying to get new film projects off the ground and support his family.  Cubby met &apos;Dana Wilson (I)&apos; (qv) at a New Year&apos;s Eve party and there was an instant attraction. The two fell in love and, after five weeks, Cubby proposed marriage. Dana flew to London and started a new life with Cubby. However, things were about to turn sour for him. After making _The Trials of Oscar Wilde (1960)_ (qv), which was financed out of his and Allen&apos;s own pockets, the two went bankrupt due to the poor box-office returns because of adverse reaction to the subject matter--&apos;Oscar Wilde&apos; (qv)&apos;s homosexuality. The film wasn&apos;t allowed to be advertised in the US and never made back its production costs during initial release. Cubby and Allen ended their partnership after the failure of the film. On June 18, 1960, Dana gave birth to a baby girl, &apos;Barbara Broccoli&apos; (qv). One night Dana asked Cubby if there was something he really wanted to do. Cubby replied. &quot;I always wanted to film the &apos;Ian Fleming (I)&apos; (qv) James Bond books.&quot;  Cubby then managed to meet with &apos;Harry Saltzman&apos; (qv), the man who held the option to the books. Together they formed Eon Productions Ltd. and Danjaq S.A. to make the first James Bond film, _Dr. No (1962)_ (qv). However, they needed financing. The two men flew to New York and met with &apos;Arthur Krim&apos; (qv), the head of United Artists. Within the hour Broccoli and Saltzman had a deal to make the first 007 film adventure. Despite the small budget of $1 million, the producers insisted on filming on location in Jamaica and using the then virtually unknown &apos;Sean Connery&apos; (qv) in the title role. Bond became the most successful film series in history and made Cubby Broccoli a household name.  Together with Saltzman, Broccoli produced _From Russia with Love (1963)_ (qv), _Goldfinger (1964)_ (qv), _Thunderball (1965)_ (qv), _You Only Live Twice (1967)_ (qv), _On Her Majesty&apos;s Secret Service (1969)_ (qv), _Diamonds Are Forever (1971)_ (qv), _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv) and _The Man with the Golden Gun (1974)_ (qv). After nine years as partners, Saltzman sold his share of Eon/Danjaq to United Artists and Cubby became the sole producer of the James Bond films. He later brought in his stepson, &apos;Michael G. Wilson (I)&apos; (qv), and his daughter Barbara, making it a true family affair. Broccoli&apos;s last non-Bond film was _Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968)_ (qv). He had purchased the rights to this &apos;Ian Fleming (I)&apos; (qv) story when he got the 007 book option. They brought in songwriters &apos;Richard M. Sherman&apos; (qv) and &apos;Robert B. Sherman&apos; (qv), who were under contract to Disney, to write the music for this musical.  In 1982 Broccoli received the Irving G. Thalberg Award for his long and successful producing career. The award was presented by &apos;Roger Moore (I)&apos; (qv) at the Academy Awards ceremony. Broccoli stated that it was one of the happiest days of his life and was very pleased to have received such a great honor. He stopped during his speech to thank all of the hundreds of crew technicians and actors who have helped make his films possible. In 1990 he was honored by having his star placed on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame and was even honored by the Queen of England for his contribution to cinema and the British community. Broccoli&apos;s last film was _Licence to Kill (1989)_ (qv). He had heart problems throughout the early 1990s and was unable to go to the set of _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv).  Cubby&apos;s last years were spent at his home in Beverly Hills, surrounded by his children and grandchildren. Despite awards, honors and an amazing film career, the most important thing in his life was his family. After undergoing a triple-bypass in 1995, Cubby Broccoli passed away on Thursday, June 27, 1996, surrounded by loved ones. He was 87 and was one of the best-loved and most respected producers in Hollywood. No one ever had anything bad to say about Cubby and, according to many, he was a gentleman who cared about every one of his cast and crew and was the last true film producer. Albert R. &quot;Cubby&quot; Broccoli&apos;s legacy lives on thanks to his family, which carries on the tradition of making the James Bond films.</biography>

      <birthName>Zahn, James Charles</birthName>
      <biography>Born in Chicago Heights, Illinois in the late 1970s, James spent much of his youth growing up in the South Suburbs of Chicago. Obsessed with pop-culture in its many forms, he spent much of his time drawing, writing, and focusing on becoming a performer of some sort.  In 1987 his original short story &quot;The Little Champ&quot; became an Illinois Young Author Award winner, and the seeds for a career as a writer were planted. Less than two years later, the budding filmmaker would also emerge.  Having grown up in front of a camera, with his childhood exploits captured by his parents on Super 8mm home movies, James shot his first short film &quot;Art Attack&quot; using the very same camera in early 1989. The film made its debut for classmates at his school.  By the time high school rolled around, all of James&apos; interests were actively being pursued. After moving to Davenport, Iowa in the spring of 1992, he began work on a cable-access program that was quite ambitious for a 15-year old. &quot;ZTV&quot; made its debut in the summer of 1992 and became a cult hit in Eastern Iowa and Western Illinois. Practically overnight, the show was featured in the local news-media, and attracted musical guests such as Faith No More, Megadeth, Stone Temple Pilots, and more. In the spring of 1994, after 40 Episodes, &quot;ZTV&quot; came to an end with a 30 minute special featuring the band &quot;White Zombie&quot;.  At the same time &quot;ZTV&quot; was on the air, James was also actively writing and taking photographs for three regional arts magazines. His published work would include interviews with artists such as Pantera, Dr. John, and Genitorturers, and led him to be a photographer at Lollapalooza &apos;93.  The mid 90s was a time of experimentation on the musical front. Zahn was soon fronting the rock band &quot;Odlid!&quot;, performing guitar and vocals. The band appeared on numerous compilation CDs, and recorded one-full length album, before breaking-up in early 1998. In addition, they performed at famed venues such as Gabe&apos;s Oasis (Iowa City), RIBCO (Rock Island, IL), and Chicago&apos;s historic Riviera Theatre, sharing the stage with acts such as Demolition Dollrods, Johnny Socko, and more.  In 2000, James returned to music with a series of unreleased demos, followed by one Internet cult favorite (Darth Vader is A Real Cool Guy), and a track for Artisan Entertainment&apos;s &quot;Blair Witchmix&quot;, an on-line soundtrack to promote the ill-fated &quot;Blair Witch 2&quot;. His track, &quot;Burkittsville&quot; was featured along 12 other tracks, by artists such as Jane&apos;s Addiction drummer Stephen Perkins, and Marilyn Manson, being performed as a part of the _Blair Witch WebFest (2000)_ (qv) .  In 2001, James returned to film, where he has been ever since, and intends to stay. He and his wife soon founded FMFE as an outlet for his creative endeavors. Since that time, James has directed numerous short films, music videos,industrials, and much more. In addition, acting had become a main passion.  Keeping the music going as well, James entered Kenosha, Wisconsin&apos;s Renwood Messenger Studios in February of 2004 to begin work on a concept project called &quot;Saturday Action Theatre&quot;, producing four acoustic tracks from those sessions. In July, he entered Bombshelter Studios in Chicago, with Producer Dan Precision (Break The Silence, Rise Against) and cut 3 electric tracks, completing what would become the &quot;Remakes and Sequels EP&quot;. The disc hit stores on August 17, 2004.  Forging ahead into a bigger filmic realm, James began work on the screenplay for &quot;Death Walks the Streets&quot; in late 2004. Completed in February 2005, the multi-genre epic spent several years in &quot;development hell&quot;, all while gaining a global fanbase. Nominated for a SpikeTV &quot;Scream Award&quot; for &quot;Most Anticipated Film&quot; in 2007 (while still in-development), the project would find new life in January 2008.  After moving forward under the control of Zahn and his writing partner &apos;Ben Brezinski&apos; (qv), &quot;Death Walks the Streets&quot; was back in-development as an independent film along with it&apos;s already-written sequel &quot;The Long December.&quot; On June 26th, 2008 Issue #0 of the comic book prequel series also called &quot;Death Walks the Streets&quot; made it&apos;s public debut at Wizard World Chicago, largely regarded as the 2nd Largest Pop-Culture Event in North America. The book quickly gained acceptance by readers and critics alike as positive reviews began appearing online. Issue #0 was published by The Scream Factory, and was called a &quot;must-have&quot; by Comics Buyer&apos;s Guide. In October 2008 it was announced that the &quot;Death Walks the Streets&quot; comic books would being published by Fangoria Graphix, the relaunched comic arm of Fangoria Magazine. After publishing only one new issue of the series and a reissue of #0, Fangoria Graphix went out of business due to continued restructuring of the parent company. The books then returned to The Scream Factory for future publication.  In addition, James continued working steadily as an actor, appearing in projects for Warner Bros., Twentieth Century Fox, and Sony Pictures. He recently appeared in the feature film _Lonely Joe (2009)_ (qv) in a supporting role alongside &apos;Erica Leerhsen&apos; (qv) of _Wrong Turn 2: Dead End (2007) (V)_ (qv) fame, and voiced several famous &quot;Transformers&quot; characters for a sketch on G4TV&apos;s &quot;Attack of the Show&quot;. In November of 2008, Zahn began appearing in television commercials for Wendy&apos;s, an American chain of fast-food restaurants. Around the same time, he appeared in an &quot;Alcohol Sales Training&quot; video for Walgreens stores.  In August of 2010, Zahn announced via Twitter that he would be taking a break from acting to focus on personal projects, including his work with Kik Axe Music. A November article with Reel Chicago revealed that not only would The Scream Factory be publishing more &quot;Death Walks the Streets&quot; books, but that a film set in the DWTS world would be in development once more at some point in the near future.  2011 saw a return to filmmaking via music videos and short films. A concept short film was created for the band Product of Hate and their song entitled &quot;Unholy Manipulator.&quot; Filmed over three days in and around Crestline, Ohio, _Hellraiser (1987)_ (qv) actress &apos;Ashley Laurence&apos; (qv) stars as the title character. With production and special FX provided by &apos;Robert Kurtzman&apos; (qv) , a mid-2012 release date is expected.  In 2012, Zahn revealed that he would be leaving his writing and editing duties at Kik Axe Music behind in order to focus on his personal site, The Rock Father. A family-friendly destination geared toward &quot;music-loving caregivers and kids,&quot; the site was expanded from a hosted blog to a standalone full-service site on February 1, 2012.  Additionally, music-centric filmmaking has continued, as Zahn directed and edited the Product of Hate music video &quot;Blood Coated Concrete&quot; (released Feb 7, 2012), the Dirge Within lyric video &quot;For My Enemies&quot; (released March 7, 2012), and the album trailer for &quot;The Industrialist,&quot; the eighth studio album from the band &apos;Fear Factory&apos; (qv) .</biography>

      <akaNames class="linked-list"/>
      <gender>MALE</gender>
      <biography>Escalante Lundy is an American film and television actor and producer, from New Orleans, LA. His most notable role is as &quot;Big Fred&quot; in Quentin Tarantino&apos;s Oscar-Nominated film, Django Unchained. Lundy also appears as a prison guard in HBO&apos;s Emmy-Nominated television series Treme and in a Pampers commercial with Super Bowl Championship Quarterback, New Orleans Saints&apos; Drew Brees.  Escalante Lundy was born in New Orleans, LA the eldest of five brothers, to Merline (nee&apos; Roy), retired real estate agent, of Rayne, LA, and Hughes Banks Lundy, a salesman from Innis, LA. Lundy graduated from St. Augustine High School, later receiving his Bachelor&apos;s degree in Urban Planning from the University of Southwestern Louisiana (USL). Lundy received Masters degrees in Urban Planning and Geographic Information Systems from the University of New Orleans.  Escalante&apos;s career began as a stage producer in Sacramento, CA. When an actor failed to show-up, Lundy took the role&apos;, garnered success and later decided to focus on acting as a career path. Admittedly, shy by nature, Lundy used acting as a tool to face his fears of public speaking and improve his diction. He continued to hone his acting skills by taking parts in small productions in film and on-stage in Los Angeles and Las Vegas.  Lundy returned to New Orleans in 2005, leaving his position with the California Department of Transportation in Sacramento. Lundy&apos;s family members were victims of Hurricane Katrina and his valiant character motivated him to permanently relocate. As the city began to rebuild, Lundy continued to pursue his new found acting passions including focusing on film roles. He studied with renowned acting coaches Veleka Grey (Young and the Restless), Lance Nichols (Curious Case of Benjamin Button and HBO Television Series, Treme) and became a fixture at the acclaimed Jerry Katz Joint (Ivana Chubback Technique). In 2007, Lundy joined the made his New Orleans theatrical debut as co-lead in the production of the &quot;Papaya Man&quot; with the Anthony Bean Community Theater (ABCT)in New Orleans. After having a challenging first rehearsal Lundy says, &quot;I tried to quit but Mr. Bean wouldn&apos;t let me. He gave me legs until I was able to run&quot;  In 2012, Lundy made his major motion picture debut as &quot;Big Fred&quot; in Quentin Tarantino&apos;s spaghetti western, Django Unchained. Lundy&apos;s role as a Mandingo fighter reflects the contrast of the powerlessness of slavery against the super human strength it took to survive such atrocities. Additionally, the grueling fight scenes Lundy appears in are riveting. Although filming the scenes was long and arduous, the efforts paid off. Tarantino directed Lundy in some of the most memorable aspects of the film.</biography>

      <biography>Nicholas - or Nick - Woodeson, born in 1949 in England to British parents - spent his early childhood in Haifa in Israel in line with his parents&apos; diplomatic postings and recalls that his first taste of thespian glory was reciting A. A. Milne poems to family friends at the age of six. Nick&apos;s strong affinity and regard for the Middle East has meant that, in the 2000s, he has written several heart-felt letters to English broadsheet newspapers expressing his views on the Middle East crisis and American involvement therein. Sent back to England to complete a boarding school education, he went on to Sussex University where his interest in drama re-surfaced and he engaged in competitive productions for the British National Student Drama Festival. As a consequence he was noticed by , and obtained his first acting job for, the theatrical repertory company at Crewe in Cheshire, England, ruefully noting in hindsight that he was usually a prompter or assistant stage manager, rather than a player. However, he soon obtained a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, and later joined the prestigious Royal Shakespeare Company, in 1981, remaining with them intermittently until 1990. He has consequently appeared in other media including films like &apos;Topsy-Turvy&apos; and television dramas like &apos;Midsomer Murders&apos; in 1998, where he played one of several murder suspects, along with actress Angela Pleasence. A year later, Angela and Nick played a mother and son in the stage play &apos;The Late Middle Classes&apos;,notwithstanding the fact that, with no more than a decade&apos;s age gap between them. From 2007, he reached a global audience as Julius Caesar&apos;s clever and loyal &quot;body slave&quot; Posca, in the BBC/HBO TV blockbuster, &apos;Rome&apos;.</biography>

      <biography>Blue-eyed Vincent Cassel was born in Paris to a leading French actor father, &apos;Jean-Pierre Cassel&apos; (qv) and a journalist mother. Often labeled as a tough guy because of his roles, eclectic choices and talent have made of him a star of European cinema. First in _La haine (1995)_ (qv), the young actor, actually coming from upper classes, succeeded to express the despair of a social class living in the suburbs of towns. This veracity in his play comes from the fact that he was in fact since years in connection with many hip-hop artists from the rising generation, (his own brother was leader of a legendary french rap group). Then the success of The crimson rivers, where he plays a young French cop alongside &apos;Jean Reno (I)&apos; (qv), made of him &quot;the man to count on.&quot; He never hid his taste for rap music, break dance, Capoeira, Brasil and his endless energy, but Vincent is also a family man, married to &apos;Monica Bellucci&apos; (qv), his Italian co-star from _L&apos;appartement (1996)_ (qv) (aka The Apartment); and recently a father.</biography>

      <birthName>Damon, Matthew Paige</birthName>
      <biography>Matthew Paige Damon, or better known to fans as Matt Damon was born in Boston Massachusetts, USA to &apos;Kent Damon&apos; (qv), a stockbroker, Realtor and tax preparer, and &apos;Nancy Carlsson-Paige&apos; (qv), an early childhood education professor at Lesley University. Matt has an older brother named Kyle who is now a sculptor. Unfortunately for Matt and his brother, their parents divorced in the year 1973.  The 5&apos;10&quot; star is of English, Scottish, Finnish, and Swedish ancestry. While his parents were still together, their family lived in Newton, before eventually settling for a divorce, where Damon and his brother moved with his mother to Cambridge. He grew up in a stable community back in Massachusetts. Matt also grew up near actor &apos;Ben Affleck&apos; (qv), when he was younger.  Matt attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School which is located in Cambridge and he performed in a number of theater productions during his time there. Later on, he was accepted into Harvard University as an English major in the fall of 1988 and was supposed to graduate with the class of 1992. While in Harvard, he kept on skipping classes to pursue acting projects, which included the TNT original film, _Rising Sun (1993)_ (qv), and prep-school drama, _School Ties (1992)_ (qv). It was until his film, _Geronimo: An American Legend (1993)_ (qv), was expected to be a big success that he decided to drop out of university completely.  Arriving in Hollywood, Matt managed to get his first break with a part in the romantic comedy, _Mystic Pizza (1988)_ (qv). However, the film did not do too well and his film career failed to take off. Not letting failure discourage him from acting, he went for another audition, and managed to get a starring role in _School Ties (1992)_ (qv).  Up next for Matt was a role as a soldier who had problems with drug-addiction in the movie, _Courage Under Fire (1996)_ (qv). Matt had, in fact, lost forty pounds for his role which resulted in health problems. The following year, he garnered accolades for _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv), a screenplay he had originally written for an English class at Harvard University. _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv) was nominated for 9 Academy Awards, one of which, Matt won for Best Original Screenplay along with &apos;Ben Affleck&apos; (qv).  In the year 1998, Matt played the title role in &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv)&apos;s film, _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv), which was one of the most acclaimed films in that year. Matt had the opportunity of working with &apos;Tom Hanks&apos; (qv) and &apos;Vin Diesel&apos; (qv) while filming that movie. That same year, he starred as an earnest law student and reformed poker player in _Rounders (1998)_ (qv), starring opposite &apos;Edward Norton (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;John Malkovich&apos; (qv).  The next year, Matt rejoined his childhood friend, &apos;Ben Affleck&apos; (qv) and fellow comedian, &apos;Chris Rock (I)&apos; (qv), in the comedy _Dogma (1999)_ (qv). Towards the end of 1999, Matt played &quot;Tom Ripley&quot;, a working-class young man who tastes the good life and will do anything to live it. Both &apos;Jude Law&apos; (qv) and &apos;Gwyneth Paltrow&apos; (qv) also starred in the movie. _The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999)_ (qv) earned mixed reviews from critics, but even so, Matt earned praise for his performance.  Matt lent his voice to the animated movie, _Titan A.E. (2000)_ (qv) in the year 2000, which also earned mixed reviews from the public. He also starred in two other movies, _All the Pretty Horses (2000)_ (qv) and the golf comedy-drama, _The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000)_ (qv), starring alongside &apos;Will Smith (I)&apos; (qv).  In the year 2003, he signed on to star in _The Informant! (2009)_ (qv) by &apos;Steven Soderbergh&apos; (qv) and the Farrelly Brothers&apos; _Stuck on You (2003)_ (qv). He also starred in _Gerry (2002)_ (qv), a film he co-wrote with his friends, &apos;Gus Van Sant&apos; (qv) and &apos;Casey Affleck&apos; (qv).  One of Matt&apos;s most recognizable work to date is his role in the &quot;Bourne&quot; movie franchise. He plays an amnesiac assassin, &quot;Jason Bourne&quot;, in _The Bourne Identity (2002)_ (qv), _The Bourne Supremacy (2004)_ (qv) and _The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)_ (qv).  Another praised role is that as &quot;Linus Caldwell&quot; in the &quot;Ocean&apos;s&quot; movie franchise. He had the opportunity to star opposite &apos;George Clooney&apos; (qv), &apos;Brad Pitt&apos; (qv), &apos;Julia Roberts (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Don Cheadle&apos; (qv) in _Ocean&apos;s Eleven (2001)_ (qv). The successful crime comedy-drama eventually had two other sequels, _Ocean&apos;s Twelve (2004)_ (qv) and _Ocean&apos;s Thirteen (2007)_ (qv).  Among other highly acclaimed movies that Matt managed to be a part of was in &apos;Terry Gilliam&apos; (qv)&apos;s _The Brothers Grimm (2005)_ (qv), &apos;George Clooney&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Syriana (2005)_ (qv), &apos;Martin Scorsese&apos; (qv)&apos;s _The Departed (2006)_ (qv) and &apos;Robert De Niro&apos; (qv)&apos;s _The Good Shepherd (2006)_ (qv).  In his personal life, Matt is now happily married to Argentine-born &apos;Luciana Barroso&apos; (qv), whom he met in Miami, where she was working as a bartender. They married in a private civil ceremony on December 9, 2005, at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. The couple have four daughters Alexia, Luciana&apos;s daughter from a previous relationship, as well as Isabella, Gia and Stella.  Matt is a big fan of the Boston Red Sox and he tries to attend their games whenever possible. He has also formed great friendships with his Ocean&apos;s co-stars, &apos;George Clooney&apos; (qv) and &apos;Brad Pitt&apos; (qv), whom he works on charity projects with. He and actor &apos;Ben Affleck&apos; (qv), together with Ben&apos;s wife, &apos;Jennifer Garner (I)&apos; (qv), are also good family friends and can be often seen going out together with Matt&apos;s wife, &apos;Luciana Barroso&apos; (qv).</biography>

      <birthName>Lewis, Lennox Claudius</birthName>
      <biography>After a long amateur career that included a gold medal winning performance in the 1988 Seoul Olympics that came in the form of a KO of &apos;Riddick Bowe&apos; (who also went on to win the world heavyweight crown), former undisputed world heavyweight boxing champion Lennox Lewis turned professional in 1989. His 2 round win over Canadian boxer Donnovan Ruddock in Oct of 1992 gained him recognition as a threat among the tough heavyweight ranks. Lewis, a citizen of England and Canada, was slated for a shot at the winner of &apos;Evander Holyfield&apos; (qv) vs Riddick Bowe. Bowe, a victim of a brutal knockout suffered at the hands of Lewis in the amateur ranks, refused to live up to his end of the bargain by not giving Lewis a well-deserved title shot and infamously tossed the WBC title in a garbage bin. This act prompted the WBC commission to strip Bowe and crown Lewis as the new WBC champion. Lennox Lewis went on to defend the crown for several fights until he was defeated by Oliver McCall in 2 rounds in Sept of 1994. Lewis, with the help of new trainer &apos;Emanuel Steward&apos; (qv), came back and began tearing his way through the ranks of the heavyweight division. Lewis was again denied a title shot when champion &apos;Mike Tyson (I)&apos; (qv) relinquished his WBC title to fight &apos;Evander Holyfield&apos; (qv) rather than risk his titles against Lewis. Lewis recaptured the vacant WBC title by beating his conquerer Oliver McCall in a rematch. Lewis, after defeating every top contender thrown his way, was given his shot at &apos;Evander Holyfield&apos; (qv) in a championship unification fight on March 13, 1999. Lewis dominated the fight but due to controversial judging, the bout was declared a draw. Lewis defeated &apos;Evander Holyfield&apos; (qv) in a rematch on Nov 13, 1999 to become undisputed world champion. Due to promoter &apos;Don King (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s underhanded tactics, the WBA belt was stripped from Lewis in court. Lewis went on to beat every mandatory challenger while keeping his crown. While avidly issuing challenges to reluctant contender &apos;Mike Tyson (I)&apos; (qv), Lewis went to Johannesburg in South Africa at the invitation of &apos;Nelson Mandela&apos; (qv). Lewis would defend his titles against supposed low-risk opponent Hasim Rahman. Due to Lewis&apos; failure to prepare for the fight by dropping excessive weight rapidly, arriving in Johannesburg 2 weeks before the fight which, according to expert opinion, was too late to acclimatize to the thin air since Johannesburg was 5,000 feet above sea level, Lewis suffered one of the biggest upsets in boxing history. However, Lewis has had his rematch with Hashim Rahman and won the title back, and he also fought &apos;Mike Tyson (I)&apos; (qv) and beaten him &apos;easily&apos; in 8 rounds.</biography>

      <birthName>McCullough, Bernard Jeffrey</birthName>
      <biography>Bernard Jeffrey McCollough was born in Chicago in 1957. He grew up in Chicago, in a rougher neighborhood than most others, with a large family living under one roof. This situation provided him with a great insight into his comedy, as his family, and the situations surrounding them would be what dominated his comedy. Mac worked in the Regal Theater, and performed in Chicago parks in his younger days. He became a professional comedian in 1977, at the age of 19. He refused to change his image for television and films, and therefore was not very well known for most of the eighties. In 1992 he made his film debut with a small part with _Mo&apos; Money (1992)_ (qv). This started a plethora of small parts in a string of movies, mostly comedies, including _Who&apos;s the Man? (1993)_ (qv), _House Party 3 (1994)_ (qv) and _The Walking Dead (1995)_ (qv). 1995 proved to be a turning point in his career. He did an HBO Special called _&quot;Midnight Mac&quot; (1995)_ (qv), and took a part as Pastor Clever in the Chris Tucker comedy _Friday (1995)_ (qv). Bernie Mac developed a cult following due to the movie and had many small parts since. In 1996 he starred in the memorable &apos;Spike Lee&apos; (qv) movie _Get on the Bus (1996)_ (qv), and was very funny in _Don&apos;t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996)_ (qv). About this time he had a recurring role in the TV series _&quot;Moesha&quot; (1996)_ (qv). Bernie Mac&apos;s star was slowly rising from this point. His next couple of movie parts were more substantial, including _How to Be a Player (1997)_ (qv) and _The Players Club (1998)_ (qv). In 1999 Bernie Mac got his most high profile part up to that point in the film _Life (1999/I)_ (qv) starring &apos;Eddie Murphy (I)&apos; (qv).  The new century started a new era for the brash Chicago comedian. He was a featured comedian in _The Original Kings of Comedy (2000)_ (qv). This performance made him more of a household name, and led to many more major parts. In 2001 he played Martin Lawrence&apos;s uncle in _What&apos;s the Worst That Could Happen? (2001)_ (qv) and later that year, was in the star studded remake of _Ocean&apos;s Eleven (2001)_ (qv). However his biggest success was _&quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot; (2001)_ (qv), which debuted in 2001 to instant acclaim. However, soon after the series ended, Mac&apos;s health took a turn for the worse. He developed sarcoidosis, an autoimmune disease which causes inflammation in the lungs. On August 9, 2008, after weeks of unsuccessful treatments, Bernie Mac died at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. He was 50.  Bernie Mac was a comedian that refused to change his image for Hollywood and said that his life in Chicago was who he was and there was nothing that could change that. He was a mature comedian who was very intelligent and very engaging in his TV, movie and stand-up appearances.</biography>

      <biography>Eli Roth began shooting Super 8 films at the age of eight, after watching Ridley Scott&apos;s _Alien (1979)_ (qv) and vomiting, and deciding he wanted to be a producer/director. With his brothers and friends, ketchup for blood and his father&apos;s power tools, he made over fifty short films before attending film school at N.Y.U., where he won a student Academy Award and graduated Summa Cum Laude in 1994. He worked in film and theater production in New York City for many years, doing every job from production assistant to assistant editor to assistant to the director. At the age of 20 Roth was development head for producer Fred Zollo, a position he soon left to write full time. To earn a living, Roth did budgets and schedules for the films _A Price Above Rubies (1998)_ (qv) and _Illuminata (1998)_ (qv) and often worked as a stand-in, where he could watch directors work with the actors. In 1995, Roth co-wrote the script that would eventually become _Cabin Fever (2002)_ (qv) with friend &apos;Randy Pearlstein&apos; (qv), and the two spent many years unsuccessfully trying to get the film financed. Roth left New York in 1999 to live in Los Angeles, and within four months got funding for his animation series _&quot;Chowdaheads&quot; (1999)_ (qv). Roth and friend &apos;Noah Belson&apos; (qv) (_Cabin Fever (2002)_ (qv)&apos;s Guitar Man) wrote and voiced the episodes, which Roth produced, directed and designed. The episodes were due to run on W.C.W.&apos;s #1 rated series _&quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; (1995)_ (qv) but the C.E.O. was fired a day before they were scheduled to air, and the episodes never ran. Roth used the episodes to set up a stop motion series called _The Rotten Fruit (2003) (V)_ (qv) which he produced, directed and animated, as well as co-wrote and voiced with friend Belson. Between the two animated series, Roth worked closely with director &apos;David Lynch (I)&apos; (qv), producing content for the website davidlynch.com. In 2001, Roth filmed _Cabin Fever (2002)_ (qv) on a shoestring budget of $1.5 million, with private equity he and his producers raised from friends and family. The film was the subject of a bidding war at the 2002 Toronto Film Festival, eventually won by Lion&apos;s Gate, instantly doubling their investors&apos; money. It went on to not only be the highest grossing film for Lion&apos;s Gate in 2003, but the most profitable horror film released that year, garnering critical acclaim from The New York Times, Rolling Stone, Empire Magazine, and such filmmakers as &apos;Peter Jackson (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Quentin Tarantino&apos; (qv) and &apos;Tobe Hooper&apos; (qv) . Roth used the film&apos;s success to launch a slew of projects, including Scavenger Hunt, a teen comedy he will write and direct for Universal Studios, and The Box, a horror thriller he is co-writing with &apos;Richard Kelly (I)&apos; (qv) that Roth will also direct. In May of 2003, Roth joined forces with filmmakers &apos;Boaz Yakin&apos; (qv), &apos;Scott Spiegel (I)&apos; (qv), and Greenestreet Films in New York to form Raw Nerve, LLC, a new production company that will produce 3-5 intense, scary, lower budget horror films annually.</biography>

      <biography>As an established and extremely talented stunt double, Zoe Bell has made a name for herself through her unparalleled dedication, skills, and focus. Bell debuts her acting career, with her already famous stunt skills, in the highly anticipated double feature _Grindhouse (2007)_ (qv) written by &apos;Quentin Tarantino&apos; (qv) and &apos;Robert Rodriguez (I)&apos; (qv). She was hand picked, by Tarentino himself, to star in his segment of the double feature, Death Proof, about four women working on the movie set of their next big hit. All seems to be going well on set until a psychotic killer begins to stalk them.  Bell began working with Tarantino well before Grindhouse hough, in _Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003)_ (qv) and _Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004)_ (qv) playing the stunt double for Uma Thurman&apos;s role, The Bride. Bell was nominated for her work in Kill Bill, Vol. 1 in the categories of Best Stunt by a Stunt Woman and Best Fight for the Taurus World Stunt Awards, both of which she would win the following year for Kill Bill: Vol. 2. Bell also showed off her stunt-woman skills as a double for Sharon Stone in Halle Barry&apos;s _Catwoman (2004)_ (qv).  Bell&apos;s talent can not only be seen on the big screen but also in the cult television series _&quot;Xena: Warrior Princess&quot; (1995)_ (qv) where she was the stunt double for Lucy Lawless. Bell also appeared as a double in the ABC thriller _&quot;Alias&quot; (2001)_ (qv) and on an episode of Cleopatra 2525 in 2000 as a double for Vicki Pratti.  In the action packed documentary _Double Dare (2004)_ (qv), Bell along with legendary stunt-woman &apos;Jeannie Epper&apos; (qv) give an insight into the career of women who take falls and punches for a living. Double Dare also gives a glimpse into the struggles of stunt-women to stay thin, employed, and sane in a male dominated career.  Bell, a native of New Zealand, currently resides in Los Angeles but hopes to someday own a home in New Zealand.</biography>

      <biography>SHAOBO QIN (Yen), a member of the internationally acclaimed Peking Acrobats makes his motion picture debut in _Ocean&apos;s Eleven (2001)_ (qv). Shaobo was rehearsing with the Peking Acrobats when he was spotted and asked to audition for the role of Yen.  Born in Guangxi, China in 1982, Shaobo saw his first acrobat performance at the age of eleven and knew immediately that was the career he wanted to pursue. Ironically, that summer when his family enrolled him in an acrobat school, he ran away after only two days. It took three more tries before he found the courage to stay enrolled and pursue the intense training. While he was still at the camp, Shaobo was seen and scouted by a troop manager for the Peking Acrobats. He eventually came to the United States where he trains in Los Angeles for the company&apos;s international tours.</biography>

      <biography>J.D. was born in the delta town of Greenville, Mississippi (also the birthplace of Muppets creator Jim Henson) on the same day Richard Nixon was elected president. He is of Irish-French-German-Cherokee-Choctaw decent, the oldest of 7 siblings, and attended 17 different schools (public and private) while moving back and forth between his mother and father. His great-great-great-great uncle was Horace Mann, the founder of the American Public School system. His father (Puddin - yep, that&apos;s what they call him) is a welder/artist/amateur archaeologist and inventor. His mother (Sally) has had many professions, including concert promoter and owner of a country/western nightclub called The Headless Horseman, where as a young child, J.D. spent many school nights until the wee hours of the morning hanging out backstage and on stage with the likes of Hank Williams, Jr., Juice Newton, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Paycheck, David Allen Coe, Ray Price, and many others.  After a short stint in college and a 15 month stint in the Marine Corps stationed at 29 Palms, California and after hanging out with some actors in L.A., J.D. thought he would give acting a shot. His only experience with acting had been playing the Prince in his pre-school production of The Nutcracker, and getting kicked out of his senior play, Oklahoma, after his second rehearsal because he and a friend drank a beer before hand. After the Marine Corps, he returned to Mississippi and worked as a debt collector for his mother&apos;s collection agency. After a year of hating his job, he decided to return to college and get a degree in theatre at The University of Southern Mississippi. Once on stage at college, he knew acting was what he had to do. His second year in theatre, he was one of 20 finalists in the state selected to attend SETC (Southeastern Theatre Conference). In 1995, a friend offered J.D. a $1,000 to come to Los Angeles and perform a lead role in his play &quot;Dylan&apos;s Ghost&quot; at the Morgan-Wixson Theatre in Santa Monica. J.D. took him up on the offer and left college a semester before graduating and since then has lived back and forth between Hollywood, California, Austin, Texas, and Oxford, Mississippi, where he just completed writing and directing his first independent feature _Glorious Mail(2005)_.  Even though he appeared on the short-lived game show, Hollywood Showdown with Todd Newton and won nearly $12,000, his friends like to tell him that he&apos;s almost one lucky son of a gun. Mainly because he&apos;s come so close to landing lead roles in major films so many times, usually being the director&apos;s second choice. In 2004 his luck proved true once again when he purchased a $100 raffle ticket and was 1st Runner Up (2nd Choice) for a $250,000 house in United Way&apos;s New Home Giveaway, where instead he won an artist&apos;s print worth $80.</biography>

He is the founder of Artists for Peace and Justice. Under this umbrella, many of his friends in the film business have come forward to build schools and medical clinics serving the children of the slums of Haiti.  He divides his time between residences in Los Angeles and New York.</biography>

      <birthName>Orozco, Alfonso Cuarón</birthName>
      <biography>Alfonso Cuarón Orozco was born on November 28th in Mexico City, Mexico. From an early age, he yearned to be either a film director or an astronaut. However, he did not want to enter the army, so he settled for directing. He didn&apos;t receive his first camera until his twelfth birthday, and then immediately started to film everything he saw, showing it afterwards to everyone. In his teen years, films were his hobby. Sometimes he said to his mother he would go to a friend&apos;s home, when in fact he would go to the cinema. His ambition was to know every theatre in the city. Near his house there were two studios, Studios Churubusco and Studios 212. After finishing school, Cuarón decided to study cinema right away. He tried to study at C.C.C. (Centro de Capacitación Cinematográfica) but wasn&apos;t accepted because at that time they weren&apos;t accepting students under twenty-four years old. His mother didn&apos;t support that idea of cinema, so he studied philosophy in the morning and in the afternoon he went to the C.U.E.C. (Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematográficos). During that time he met many people who would later become his collaborators and friends. One of them was &apos;Luis Estrada (I)&apos; (qv). Cuaron also became good friends with &apos;Carlos Marcovich&apos; (qv) and &apos;Emmanuel Lubezki&apos; (qv). Luis Estrada directed a short called &quot;Vengance is Mine&quot;, on which Alfonso and Emmanuel collaborated. The film was in English, a fact which bothered many teachers of the C.U.E.C. such as &apos;Marcela Fernández Violante (I)&apos; (qv). The disagreement caused such arguments that in 1985, Alfonso was expelled from the university.  During his time studying at C.U.E.C. he met &apos;Mariana Elizondo&apos; (qv), and with her he had his first son, &apos;Jonás Cuarón&apos; (qv). After Alfonso was expelled, he thought he could never be a director and so went on to work in a Museum so he could sustain his family. One day, &apos;José Luis García Agraz&apos; (qv) and Fernando CáMara went to the museum and made an offer to Cuarón. They asked him to work as cable person in &quot;_La víspera (1982)_ (qv)&quot;, a job which was to prove to be his salvation. After that he was assistant director in Garcia Agraz&apos;s &quot;_Nocaut (1984)_ (qv)&quot;, as well as numerous other films.  He was also second unit director in &quot;_Gaby: A True Story (1987)_ (qv)&quot;, and co-wrote and directed some episodes in the series &quot;_&quot;A Hora Marcada&quot; (1967)_ (qv)&quot;. One New Year&apos;s Eve, he decided he would not continue to be an assistant director, and with his brother Carlos started writing what would be his first feature film: &quot;_Sólo con tu pareja (1991)_ (qv)&quot; (Love in the time of Hysteria). After the screenplay was written, the problem became how to get financial backing for the movie. I.M.C.I.N.E. (Instituto Mexicano de Cinematografia), which supports movies financially, had already decided which projects it would support that year, much to Alfonso&apos;s initial chagrin. However, the director of one of those already-chosen projects was unable to direct it, so his project was canceled, and &quot;Sólo con tu pareja&quot; took its place. Despite this being chosen, there was a lot of tension between Alfonso and the I.M.C.I.N.E. executives. Nevertheless, after the movie was finished, it was a huge success. In Toronto festival the films won many awards, and Alfonso started to be noticed by Hollywood producers. &apos;Sydney Pollack&apos; (qv) was the first one to invite him to shoot in Hollywood. He proposed a feature film to be directed by Alfonso, but the project didn&apos;t work and was canceled. Alfonso moved to Los Angeles without anything concrete, and stayed with some friends, as he had no money. Soon after that, Pollack called him again to direct an episode called &quot;_&quot;Fallen Angels&quot; (1993) {Murder, Obliquely (#1.5)}_ (qv)&quot; of the series &quot;_&quot;Fallen Angels&quot; (1993)_ (qv)&quot;, that was the first job he had in U.S., and also the first time he worked with &apos;Alan Rickman&apos; (qv).  After a while, and no real directing jobs, Alfonso wanted to direct something as he needed money. He finally signed a contract with Warner Brothers to direct the film _Addicted to Love (1995) (V)_ (qv). However, one night, he read the screenplay for another film, _A Little Princess (1995)_ (qv) and fell in love with it. He talked to Warner Brothers and after some meetings he gave up directing &quot;Addicted to Love&quot; in order to do &quot;A Little Princess&quot;. Even thought it wasn&apos;t a great box office success, the film received two nominations for the Oscars, and won many other awards. After &quot;A Little Princess&quot; Alfonso developed a project with &apos;Richard Gere&apos; (qv) starring. The project was canceled, but Cuarón got an offer from Twentieth Century Fox to direct the modern adaptation of the Charles Dickens&apos; classic _Great Expectations (1998)_ (qv). He initially didn&apos;t want to direct it but the studio insisted, and in the end he accepted it. The experience was very painful and difficult for him mainly because there was never a definitive screenplay.  He then reunited with producer &apos;Jorge Vergara (I)&apos; (qv) and founded both Anhelo Productions and Moonson Productions. Anhelo&apos;s first picture was also Alfonso&apos;s next film, the erotic road movie &quot;_Y tu mamá también (2001)_ (qv)&quot;, which was a huge success. During the promotion of the film in Venice, Alfonso met the cinema critic &apos;Annalisa Bugliani&apos; (qv). They started dating and married that same year. &quot;_Children of Men (2006)_ (qv)&quot; was to be Alfonso&apos;s next film, a futuristic, dystopian story. During the preproduction of the film, Warner Brothers invited Alfonso to direct the third Harry Potter film, &quot;_Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)_ (qv)&quot;, an offer which he accepted after some consideration. The film would prove to be the greatest box office success of his career.  In 2003, he had a daughter named &apos;Tess Bu Cuarón&apos; (qv), and in February 2005 another son, called Olmo Teodoro Cuarón. Alfonso Cuarón signed a three-year first-look deal with Warner Brothers, which allowed his films to be distributed world-wide. As a result of that deal, he developed two new projects, _History of Love, The (2007)_ and _Memory of Running, The (2007)_. He also developed another Mexican film &quot;_México &apos;68 (2007)_&quot;, about the violent students&apos; revolt that happened in Mexico in 1968. He directed one five-minute segment of the anthology film _Paris, je t&apos;aime (2006)_ (qv) with &apos;Nick Nolte&apos; (qv) and &apos;Ludivine Sagnier&apos; (qv). His next project, the futuristic film _Children of Men (2006)_ (qv) with &apos;Clive Owen (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Julianne Moore&apos; (qv) and &apos;Michael Caine (I)&apos; (qv) premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2006 having been nominated for three Academy Awards. After his youngest son was diagnosed with autism and the divorce from Annalisa Bugliani he took a break from directing and settled in London where he plans to work on his next projects.  In 2013, Alfonso directed the space thriller _Gravity (2013)_ (qv), which would go win 7 academy awards.</biography>

      <biography>&apos;Guillermo del Toro&apos; (qv) was born October 9, 1964 in Guadalajara Jalisco, Mexico. Raised by his Catholic grandmother, del Toro developed an interest in filmmaking in his early teens. Later, he learned about makeup and effects from the legendary &apos;Dick Smith (II)&apos; (qv) (_The Exorcist (1973)_ (qv)) and worked on making his own short films. At the age of 21, del Toro executive produced his first feature, Dona Herlinda and Her Son (1986). Del Toro spent almost 10 years as a makeup supervisor, and formed his own company, Necropia in the early 1980s. He also produced and directed Mexican television programs at this time, and taught film.  del Toro got his first big break when _Cronos (1993)_ (qv) won nine academy awards in Mexico, then went on to win the International Critics Week prize at Cannes. Following this success, del Toro made his first Hollywood film, _Mimic (1997)_ (qv), starring &apos;Mira Sorvino&apos; (qv).  del Toro had some unfortunate experiences working with a demanding Hollywood studio on _Mimic (1997)_ (qv), and returned to Mexico to form his own production company, The Tequila Gang.  Next for del Toro, was _El espinazo del diablo (2001)_ (qv), a Spanish Civil War ghost story. The film was hailed by critics and audiences alike, and del Toro decided to give Hollywood another try. In 2002, he directed the &apos;Wesley Snipes&apos; (qv) vampire sequel, _Blade II (2002)_ (qv).  On a roll, Del Toro followed up _Blade II (2002)_ (qv) with another successful comic-book inspired film, _Hellboy (2004)_ (qv), starring one of Del Toro&apos;s favorite actors, &apos;Ron Perlman&apos; (qv).  Married with children, del Toro lives in Los Angeles.</biography>

      <biography>American actor Casey Affleck has an onscreen career dating back to 1988, but his Academy Award nominated work in _The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)_ (qv) gained him wider acclaim in recent years.  Affleck, the younger brother of &apos;Ben Affleck&apos; (qv), was born Caleb Casey McGuire Affleck-Boldt on 12 August 1975 in Falmouth, Massachusetts to middle-class parents; his mother was a school district employee and teacher, and father was a drug counselor who also served as a social worker, auto mechanic, custodian and bartender. He was also part of the Theater Company of Boston.  Affleck appeared in various roles on television while finishing high school and attending university, including as young Robert Kennedy in the TV mini-series _&quot;The Kennedys of Massachusetts&quot; (1990)_ (qv). After graduating high school, he attended George Washington University and eventually transferred into Columbia University in New York, but he never earned his Bachelor&apos;s degree.  Affleck&apos;s first major film role was in &apos;Gus Van Sant&apos; (qv)&apos;s _To Die For (1995)_ (qv), in which he co-starred with his future brother-in-law &apos;Joaquin Phoenix&apos; (qv) and &apos;Nicole Kidman&apos; (qv). He would go on to appear in two films with his brother, _Chasing Amy (1997)_ (qv) and _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv), which &apos;Ben Affleck&apos; (qv) co-wrote with &apos;Matt Damon&apos; (qv). Affleck then chose a variety of roles, most of which were considered to be commercial failures, including _Drowning Mona (2000)_ (qv), a modern version of _Hamlet (2000)_ (qv) and _Soul Survivors (2001)_ (qv). He also co-wrote the screenplay _Gerry (2002)_ (qv) with &apos;Gus Van Sant&apos; (qv) and &apos;Matt Damon&apos; (qv), which received a limited release in the United States.  But 2001 brought Affleck a plum role as part of Ocean&apos;s Eleven&apos;s ensemble cast. Affleck&apos;s character, a getaway driver named Virgil Malloy, reappeared in _Ocean&apos;s Twelve (2004)_ (qv) and _Ocean&apos;s Thirteen (2007)_ (qv). Affleck also received positive critical notice for his work in _Gone Baby Gone (2007)_ (qv), and directed &apos;Joaquin Phoenix&apos; (qv) in the &quot;hoax-umentary&quot; _I&apos;m Still Here (2010/I)_ (qv). He also recently co-starred in the ensemble comedy _Tower Heist (2011)_ (qv).  Affleck has signed on to star in the independent movie _Ain&apos;t Them Bodies Saints (2013)_, described as a Bonnie &amp; Clyde-inspired tale about an escaped convict on the run through Texas, trying to reunite with his wife and daughter. He is married &apos;Summer Phoenix&apos; (qv), to whom he was introduced by her brother Joaquin. The couple has two sons.</biography>

      <biography>Steven Soderbergh was born on January 14, 1963, in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, the second of six children and, while still at a very young age, his family moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father, &apos;Peter Soderbergh&apos; (qv), was a professor and the dean of the College of Education at Louisiana State University. While still in high school, around the age of 15, Soderbergh enrolled in the university&apos;s film animation class and began making short 16-millimeter films with second-hand equipment, one of which was the short film &quot;Janitor&quot;. After graduating high school, he went to Hollywood, where he worked as a freelance editor. His time there was brief and, shortly after, he returned home and continued making short films and writing scripts.  His first major break was in 1986 when the rock group &apos;Yes&apos; (qv) assigned him to shoot a full-length concert film for the band, which eventually earned him a Grammy nomination for the video, _Yes: 9012 Live (1985) (V)_ (qv). Following this achievement, Soderbergh filmed _Winston (1987)_ (qv), the short-subject film that he would later expand into _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv), a film that earned him the Cannes Film Festival&apos;s Palme d&apos;Or Award, the Independent Spirit Award for Best Director, and an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Over the next six years, he was married to actress &apos;Betsy Brantley&apos; (qv) and had a daughter named Sarah Soderbergh, who was born in 1990.  Also during this time, he made such films as _Kafka (1991)_ (qv), _King of the Hill (1993)_ (qv), _Underneath (1995)_ (qv) and _Gray&apos;s Anatomy (1996)_ (qv), which many believed to be disappointments. In 1998, Soderbergh made _Out of Sight (1998)_ (qv), his most critically and commercially successful film since _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv). Then, in 2000, Soderbergh directed two major motion pictures that are now his most successful films to date: _Erin Brockovich (2000)_ (qv) and _Traffic (2000)_ (qv). These films were both nominated for Best Picture Oscars at the 2001 Academy Awards and gave him the first twin director Oscar nomination in almost 60 years and the first ever win. He won the Oscar for Best Director for _Traffic (2000)_ (qv) at the 2001 Oscars.</biography>

      <biography>When you grow up in America&apos;s most dangerous city, Flint, MI, a dream like this seems completely unobtainable and vaguely ludicrous. The external forces of drugs, violence, and poverty exude the power of influence, yet Kay&apos;s internal quest for absolute freedom through acting could not be ignored.  Kay was accepted into Harvard University&apos;s American Repertory Theater/Moscow Art Theatre School Institute in 2013. Her intense desire to achieve greatness and personal freedom pointed Kay to the theater. She has been given the opportunity to channel her once private emotions and experiences in a positive manner. Suddenly, the abandonment caused by her parents&apos; drug and alcohol addictions, the pain caused by premature sensual attention, and her unprecedented level of focus caused by bullies became worth sharing.  In 2004, Kay obtained a B.A. in Communications and a M.A. in Public Relations from Michigan State University, however it led Kay to sitting behind desks, observing human behavior versus standing on stages illuminating human behavior. It was not until she moved to New Orleans in 2010 that she discovered true happiness and the buried talent that was screaming for attention. The film industry started taking the city by storm after Hurricane Katrina, and Kay subconsciously wanted to know more about it.  Kay started as a featured background artist, yet she was handpicked by four Academy Award winners and nominees. Michael Jackson once said, &quot;Study the great and become greater.&quot; Observing and learning from Quentin Tarantino, Gavin Hood, Richard LaGravenese and Lee Daniels caused Kay to take a much-needed inward look. Within one year, she arose from the background and became a principle player.</biography>

After graduating from Florida State with a BA in Media Production, he moved to Los Angeles and produced reality television shows such as _&quot;Ripley&apos;s Believe It or Not!&quot; (1999)_ (qv) and _E!&apos;s Live Countdown to the 2003 Primetime Emmy Awards (2003) (TV)_ (qv).  After four years in reality he decided to pursue a career in acting and writing.  Since the shift he&apos;s written, acted in and/or produced various independent features, including 2012&apos;s critically acclaimed improvised film _Goodbye Promise (2012)_ (qv), which the LA Times called &quot;a visually alert, enormously well-observed film that deftly captures Hollywood heartbreak,&quot; giving credit to Collins&apos; &quot;appealing and affecting&quot; performance.  Legendary Producer &apos;Fred Roos&apos; (qv) said this about _Goodbye Promise (2012)_ (qv): &quot;On a micro budget, Filmmaker &apos;David Branin&apos; (qv) and Actor &apos;Gregor Collins&apos; (qv) have created a perceptive and touching portrait of the lives of struggling actors working on the fringes of Hollywood.&quot;  In 2008, after a chance meeting with a renowned Holocaust refugee named &apos;Maria Altmann&apos; (qv), Collins became her caregiver for the last three years of her life. In 2012 he published a book about his unique experience called &quot;The Accidental Caregiver,&quot; which subsequently became a bestseller on Amazon.</biography>

      <biography>Lasco Atkins was born in Hong Kong in 1980. At an early age he already knew he loved films, mainly action movies starring Arnie, Sly, JCVD, etc. Once at film school he learned a new appreciation for classics, black &amp; whites, 70s, etc. He re-watched old films such as Blade Runner and no longer thought of them as boring but as visual masterpieces. He started making videos of skits with friends and skateboarding videos. At Art College (Surrey Institute in Farnham) he tried video editing for the first time, where he mainly made OTT videos. At Film School he shot on film stock for the first time and edited on Steen-beck also. He developed a wider understanding and appreciation for how films were/are made. Going in only wanting to be a director, he came out of LFS (London Film School) as a cameraman. Once he left film school, he began focus pulling/camera assistant. Eventually he caught the lighting bug. This is extremely helpful for young DP&apos;s since they must have a good knowledge of lights and camera. Occasionally directing, he also acts on bigger budget films. He is happy anywhere on a film set, either in front, behind or anywhere as long as the project is valuable and an experience. Lately he has even tried his hands at rapping, appearing in two of his own music videos this year already (2013) known as Lasco Tobasco.</biography>

      <birthDateAsString>9 December 1960</birthDateAsString>
      <biography>Actor/writer/producer Todd Allen counts &apos;Gregory Peck&apos; (qv), &apos;Marlon Brando&apos; (qv), &apos;Steve McQueen (I)&apos; (qv), John Wayne, Alan Ladd, Ward Bond, Lee Marvin and &apos;Robert Mitchum&apos; (qv) among those actors who both influenced and inspired him to be an actor.  Allen has appeared in over 50 film and television productions and considers himself fortunate to have had the ability and opportunity to work in both film and television. He is filming the inspirational sports drama, &quot;My All American&quot; written and directed by Angelo Pizzo and most recently appeared in Quentin Tarantino&apos;s blockbuster Django Unchained as a very Gary Cooper-eque (according to Tarantino) plantation overseer named, &quot;Dollar Bill.&quot; In another recent film, Allen completed a starring role in the independent feature, _Frontera (2010)_ (qv), playing a tough, driven Texas Ranger who brings down a powerful drug cartel. The film is yet to be released, but Allen remains hopeful that it will find a market. Recent television appearances include the NBC/Bruckheimer Pilot, _Chase (2010)_ (qv) and a recurring role on _&quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; (2006)_ (qv). Allen also co-starred with &apos;Robert Duvall&apos; (qv) in Duvall&apos;s Academy Award-nominated film, _The Apostle (1997)_ (qv) and, more recently, co-starred with Duvall again in AMC&apos;s Emmy Award-winning original mini-series, _&quot;Broken Trail&quot; (2006)_ (qv), playing the well-reviewed role of &quot;Marshal Bill Miller,&quot; a man who carries severed human ears on his watch chain. In _American Identity (2007)_ (qv), Allen both produced and co-starred as a battle-hardened Marine Master Sergeant, with a sly sense of humor and a definite command of the battle field, in the deserts of Afghanistan. Other career highlights include three films with &apos;Lawrence Kasdan&apos; (qv), three films with &apos;Kevin Costner&apos; (qv), and playing fighter ace &apos;Chuck Yeager&apos; (qv) in a Hallmark Hall of Fame special presentation. He has many guest-starring roles on television, including appearances on _&quot;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&quot; (2000)_ (qv), _&quot;NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service&quot; (2003)_ (qv), _&quot;Monk&quot; (2002)_ (qv), and a movie for Hallmark entitled _Claire (2007) (TV)_ (qv).  Allen will launch an independent media and production company in 2014 and has a number of exceptional feature film properties and television projects in development. Among them are two film projects he plans to direct. Allen has also written several highly regarded screenplays. His first screenplay, a gritty, film-noir styled Western, &quot;The Deserters&quot;, was the subject of much competition among studios but Allen held the project for its original intent which was a starring role for himself. Since Allen is now gray headed and has low back problems, he is now considering directing the film rather than starring in it so he doesn&apos;t have to do any more of his own stunts. Other well received screenplays include, &quot;Suicide Grip,&quot; a romantic thrill ride set against the exciting backdrop of the National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas. &quot;The Empty Quarter,&quot; is a cautionary tale set on an explosive gas well in Saudi Arabia&apos;s most barren desert and &quot;Rio Grande&quot; is based on the best selling memoir, One Ranger, which details the life and career of a legendary Texas Ranger along the volatile Texas/Mexico border.  Allen maintains residences in Los Angeles and his hometown of Austin, Texas. Flight crews on Southwest Airlines love him.</biography>

      <biography>Robbie Coltrane, one of Britain&apos;s most popular comedians who was head of debating society at school and won prizes for his art, is now a film star who played in two James Bond films and in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; franchise.  He was born Anthony Robert McMillan on March 30, 1950, in Rutherglen, a suburb of Glasgow, Scotland, UK. His father, Ian McMillan, was a general surgeon who also worked for police pathology. His mother, Jean, was a teacher and a pianist. Young Robbie was fond of art, music, films and cars. He was a voracious reader of his dad&apos;s books on medicine and crime. At age 12 he made his acting debut on stage at Glenalmond College, delivering rants from &quot;Henry V&quot;. At that time he was fascinated with &apos;Marlon Brando&apos; (qv) and &apos;Orson Welles&apos; (qv).  He attended Glasgow Art School, majoring in drawing, painting and film, then studied art at Edinburgh&apos;s Moray House College of Education for a year. In 1973 he made a documentary titled &quot;Young Mental Health&quot;, which was voted Film Of The Year by the Scottish Education Council. At that time Robbie took the name Coltrane, due to his love of jazz, and began a career of a stand-up comedian at night clubs, at the Edinburgh Festival, as well as an actor with Edinburgh&apos;s renowned Traverse Theatre.  In 1980 Coltrane made his debut on television as &quot;Border Guard&quot; in BBC&apos;s mini-series _&quot;The Lost Tribe&quot; (1980)_ (qv), then made his big screen debut as a limousine driver in _La mort en direct (1980)_ (qv). In 1981 he appeared in his first leading role as Detective Fritz Langley in _Subway Riders (1981)_ (qv), by famed underground director &apos;Amos Poe&apos; (qv).  He became a well-known face through appearances in The Comic Strip series, then in _&quot;Alfresco&quot; (1983)_ (qv) and Comic Strip movies _The Supergrass (1985)_ (qv) and _The Pope Must Die (1991)_ (qv), among other films. At that time Coltrane had a drinking problem, downing as much as a bottle of whiskey a day. In 1986 he flew to a clinic in Mexico and was treated for obesity. In 1987 his partner for 15 years, Robin Paine, left him for good, leaving her portrait in Coltrane&apos;s barn.  In 1988 Coltrane met then 18-year-old Rhona Gemmell in a pub. They married and had a son, Spencer, and a daughter, Alice. His career took off during the early 1990s with the leading role as Dr. Eddie &quot;Fitz&quot; Fitzgerald, a forensic psychologist, in the popular TV series _&quot;Cracker&quot; (1993)_ (qv).  He made such a good performance as Valentin Zukovsky, a KGB man turned St. Petersburg mafia lord, in _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv) the producers called him back for the same character in _The World Is Not Enough (1999)_ (qv). Then Coltrane hit another lucrative franchise; he was personally selected by &apos;J.K. Rowling&apos; (qv) as her choice to play half-giant Rubeus Hagrid in the &apos;Harry Potter&apos; films.  In early 1990s Coltrane wrote an autobiography, &quot;Coltrane in a Cadillac&quot;, and also starred in the eponymous TV series, _&quot;Coltrane in a Cadillac&quot; (1993)_ (qv), in which he indulges his passion for vintage cars and tells with great humor about his 4000-mile journey across America from Los Angeles to New York. In 2003 he separated from his wife. His interests outside of his acting profession has been reading books, and rebuilding and collecting vintage cars. Robbie Coltrane resides in a converted farmhouse in Stirlingshire, Scotland, UK.</biography>

      <biography>Alan Cumming was born on January 27, 1965, in Aberfeldy, Scotland. His family lived nearby in Dunkeld, where his father, Alex, was a forester for Atholl Estate. The family (Alex, mother Mary, big brother Tom and Alan) moved to Fassfern near Fort William soon after, before moving to the east coast of Scotland in 1969 where Alan&apos;s dad took up the position of Head Forester of Panmure Estate, and it was here Alan grew up. He went to Monikie Primary School and Carnoustie High School, where he began appearing in plays, and soon after that began working with with the Carnoustie Theatre Club and Carnoustie Musical Society. In 1981 he left high school with 8 &apos;O&apos; Grades and 4 Highers, but because he was too young to enter any university or drama school he worked for just over a year as a sub-editor at D.C. Thomson Publishers in Dundee. There he worked on the launch of a new magazine, &quot;Tops&quot;, and was also the &quot;Young Alan&quot; who answered readers&apos; letters. In September 1982 he began a three-year course at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow. He graduated in 1985 with a B.A. (Dramatic Studies) and awards for verse speaking and direction. He also had formed a cabaret double act with fellow student &apos;Forbes Masson&apos; (qv) called Victor and Barry, which went on to become hugely successful with tours (including two Perrier Pick of the Fringe seasons in London and a month-long engagement at the Sydney Opera House as part of an Australian tour), records (&quot;Hear Victor and Barry and Faint&quot;, &quot;Are We Too Loud?&quot;) and many TV appearances throughout the UK. Before graduating Alan made his professional theater and film debuts in &quot;Macbeth&quot; at the Tron Theatre in Glasgow and in &apos;Gillies MacKinnon&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;Passing Glory&quot;. After graduating Alan worked extensively in Scottish theater and television, including a stint on the soap opera _&quot;Take the High Road&quot; (1980)_ (qv) before moving to London when &quot;Conquest of the South Pole&quot;, a play by German playwright &apos;Manfred Karge&apos; (qv), transferred from the Traverse Theatre in, Edinburgh to the the Royal Court in London, earning him his first Olivier award nomination for Most Promising Newcomer of 1988.  Alan performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company and then the Royal National Theatre, where he starred in &quot;Accidental Death of an Anarchist&quot;, which he also adapted with director &apos;Tim Supple&apos; (qv). The production was nominated for Best revival at the 1991 Olivier awards and Alan won for Comedy Performance of the Year. Then his film career began with &apos;Ian Sellar (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Prague (1992)_ (qv), in which he starred with &apos;Sandrine Bonnaire&apos; (qv) and &apos;Bruno Ganz&apos; (qv). The film premiered at the 1992 Cannes film festival and went on to win him Best Actor award at the Atlantic Film Festival and a Scottish BAFTA Best Actor nomination. In the same year he made two films for the BBC - _&quot;Screen Two&quot; (1985) {The Last Romantics (#8.11)}_ (qv) and _Bernard and the Genie (1991) (TV)_ (qv), the latter winning him the Top Television Newcomer award at 1992 British Comedy Awards. In the 1992 Olivier awards he was also nominated for Comedy Performance of the Year for &quot;La Bete&quot;. In 1993 he played Hamlet for the English Touring Theare to great critical acclaim (&quot;An actor knocking on the door of greatness&quot; - Daily Mail; ranked first and second--with his performance in &quot;Cabaret&quot;--in the Daily Telegraph&apos;s performances of the year) and then immediately went on to play the Emcee in &apos;Sam Mendes (I)&apos; (qv)&apos; revival of &quot;Cabaret&quot; at the same venue (London&apos;s Donmar Warehouse). He received a 1994 Olivier award nomination for Best Actor in a Musical for &quot;Cabaret&quot;, and for Hamlet he received the 1994 TMA Best Actor award and a Shakespeare Globe award nomination.  In 1994 he made his first Hollywood film, _Circle of Friends (1995)_ (qv), and his performance as the oleaginous Sean Walsh along with those in two films released in quick succession (_Emma (1996)_ (qv) and _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv)) brought him to the attention of American producers, and he appeared in several Hollywood films, such as _Romy and Michele&apos;s High School Reunion (1997)_ (qv) and _Buddy (1997)_ (qv). He returned to the UK in 1997 to work with &apos;Stanley Kubrick&apos; (qv) and the &apos;Spice Girls&apos; (qv) before returning stateside in 1998 to reprise his role in &quot;Cabaret&quot; on Broadway. The show and his portrayal were a sensation, and he received the Tony, Drama Desk, Outer Critics&apos; Circle, Theatre World, FANY, New York Press and New York Public Advocate&apos;s awards for his performance. Since then he has alternated between theater and films, and also between smaller independent films and more mainstream fare. His theater work includes 2001&apos;s &quot;Design for Living&quot; on Broadway and the hugely successful off-Broadway &quot;Elle&quot; by &apos;Jean Genet&apos; (qv), which he adapted and played the lead in 2002. Films have included &apos;Julie Taymor&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Titus (1999)_ (qv), _Urbania (2000)_ (qv), the &quot;Spy Kids&quot; trilogy, _Josie and the Pussycats (2001)_ (qv), _X2 (2003)_ (qv), _Nicholas Nickleby (2002)_ (qv), _Son of the Mask (2005)_ (qv) and the Showtime movie musical _Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical (2005) (TV)_ (qv). He wrote, directed, produced and acted in _The Anniversary Party (2001)_ (qv) with &apos;Jennifer Jason Leigh&apos; (qv), which premiered at the Cannes Film festival in 2002 and went on to win a National Board of Review award and two Independent Spirit award nominations. More recently he has produced the documentary Show People (2004) and the films _Sweet Land (2005)_ (qv) and _Full Grown Men (2006)_ (qv) (and appears in both) and acted in _Gray Matters (2006/I)_ (qv) opposite &apos;Heather Graham (I)&apos; (qv) and _Bam Bam and Celeste (2005)_ (qv) opposite &apos;Margaret Cho&apos; (qv). in 2006 he will return to Broadway as Macheath in &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;. He has also found the time to write a novel, &quot;Tommy&apos;s Tale&quot;, in 2002 and a fragrance, &quot;Cumming&quot; in 2005.</biography>

      <biography>Best known for his starring role as Det. Sonny Crockett on the hugely successful TV series _&quot;Miami Vice&quot; (1984)_ (qv), Don Johnson is one of the stars who really defined the 1980s. As James &quot;Sonny&quot; Crockett he went toe-to-toe with drug dealers, pimps, prostitutes, assassins, illegal arms-dealers and crooked cops on a weekly basis from 1984 to 1989, appearing in a grand total of 110 episodes. The show, which was executive-produced by four time Oscar-nominated director, producer and writer &apos;Michael Mann (I)&apos; (qv), paired Johnson with the equally cool &apos;Philip Michael Thomas&apos; (qv) as Det. Ricardo Tubbs and the calm and stoic presence of &apos;Edward James Olmos&apos; (qv) as Lt. Martin Castillo. It revolutionized television with its modern fashion, pop music, unique style and use of real locations. Johnson typically wore $1000 Armani, Versace and Hugo Boss suits over pastel cotton T-shirts, drove a Ferrari 365 GTS/4 Daytona (later a Ferrari Testarossa) and lived on an Endeavour 42-foot sailboat named &quot;St. Vitus&apos; Dance&quot; with his pet alligator Elvis. He also had full use of an offshore powerboat. Still, &quot;Miami Vice&quot; had not only style but substance, and his portrayal of the Vietnam veteran turned vice detective turned Sonny Crockett into the world&apos;s favorite cop. For his work on &quot;Miami Vice&quot; Johnson won a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a TV Series in 1986, and was nominated in the same category a year later. He also picked up an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1985.  Johnson was born in Flat Creek, Missouri, the son of a farmer and a beautician. As a kid he wanted to become a professional bowler. Later, after a few brushes with the law at a young age, he discovered acting. After working on the stage for a while he ventured into films and television, but was not able to break into stardom despite, among other things, starring in the sci-fi cult classic _A Boy and His Dog (1975)_ (qv). During the late 1960s and early 70s, Johnson had two short-lived marriages that were annulled; the names of his first two wives have never been made public. &apos;Tippi Hedren&apos; (qv), Johnson&apos;s co-star in _The Harrad Experiment (1973)_ (qv), allowed him to date her daughter &apos;Melanie Griffith&apos; (qv) despite the fact that she was only 14 and he was 22; the relationship culminated in a six-month marriage during 1976. In the 1980s he lived with actress &apos;Patti D&apos;Arbanville&apos; (qv) and they had one son together. He remarried Griffith in 1989, but divorced in 1996 when she left him for &apos;Antonio Banderas&apos; (qv). Johnson has been married to fifth wife Kelly Phleger since 1999, and they have three children together.  Johnson starred in four failed TV pilots before landing his career-high role on &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, which propelled him to superstardom. He directed four highly praised episodes of the show, one of them co-starring Melanie Griffith. He balanced his work on the series by appearing in the critically acclaimed TV film _The Long Hot Summer (1985) (TV)_ (qv), an adaptation of the &apos;William Faulkner (I)&apos; (qv) novel, and the film _Sweet Hearts Dance (1988)_ (qv) with &apos;Susan Sarandon&apos; (qv). After the series ended he focused solely on his film career. Although movies like _Dead Bang (1989)_ (qv), _The Hot Spot (1990)_ (qv) and _Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man (1991)_ (qv) did not fare well with the critics, quite a few of them have obtained a considerable cult following, with fans praising them as all being quality contributions to their genre. His film work has given Johnson the opportunity to work with legendary filmmakers like &apos;John Frankenheimer&apos; (qv), &apos;Sidney Lumet&apos; (qv) and &apos;Dennis Hopper&apos; (qv).  After working steadily, Johnson returned to TV in 1996 with the cop show _&quot;Nash Bridges&quot; (1996)_ (qv). The show, which Johnson created and produced, did very well. It co-starred &apos;Cheech Marin&apos; (qv) and &apos;Jodi Lyn O&apos;Keefe&apos; (qv). Johnson played the title role, a captain in the San Francisco PD&apos;s Special Investigations Unit. He was again paired with a flashy vehicle, this time an electric-yellow 1971 Plymouth Barracuda convertible. After &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; went off the air Johnson kept a low profile, but continues to appear in films and on television. He starred in the failed WB courtroom drama _&quot;Just Legal&quot; (2005)_ (qv), which was produced by &apos;Jerry Bruckheimer&apos; (qv), and has traveled to Europe to make such films as the Norwegian screwball comedy _Lange flate ballær II (2008)_ (qv) and the Italian films _Bastardi (2008)_ (qv) and _Torno a vivere da solo (2008)_ (qv). He will soon be seen in the romantic comedy _When in Rome (2010)_ (qv) with &apos;Anjelica Huston&apos; (qv) and &apos;Danny DeVito&apos; (qv), as well as the indie comedy _A Good Old Fashioned Orgy (2011)_ (qv). &apos;Don Johnson (I)&apos; starred in the 2007 feature film, _&quot;Moondance Alexander&quot; (2007)_, along with &apos;Lori Loughlin&apos; (qv), &apos;Kay Panabaker&apos; (qv), &apos;James Best (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Sasha Cohen (I)&apos; (qv), and &apos;Whitney Sloan&apos; (qv).</biography>

      <biography>Pittsburgh-born actor/SFX wizard/stuntman/director Tom Savini did a tour of duty as a combat cameraman in Vietnam, and has since acquired a remarkable cult following among film fans, primarily due to his ground-breaking SFX in the &quot;splatter movie&quot; explosion of the early 1980s. Along with fellow special make-up legends &apos;Dick Smith (II)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Rob Bottin&apos; (qv), Savini was one of the key SFX people behind the startling make-up &amp; EFX seen in the fantasy/horror genre films of the 1980s-&apos;90s. Savini was heavily influenced by the remarkable silent-era actor &apos;Lon Chaney&apos; (qv), and he sought to emulate the amazing theatrical make-up effects that were a hallmark of Chaney&apos;s career. In Savini&apos;s insightful book &quot;Grande Illusions&quot;, he speaks of his early attempts at applying prosthetics to his face using &quot;spearmint gum&quot;, having misinterpreted that he was meant to actually use &quot;spirit gum&quot;!  His first work was in low-budget fare, providing SFX and make-up for independently made horror films such as _Deranged (1974)_ (qv) and _Martin (1976)_ (qv). However, he really caught the attention of horror buffs with his grisly effects in the cult &apos;George A. Romero (I)&apos; (qv)-directed zombie film _Dawn of the Dead (1978)_ (qv), and then in the controversial slasher film _Friday the 13th (1980)_ (qv), the movie generally identified as the kickstart for the aforementioned &quot;splatter movie&quot; genre. Savini also contributed the incredible EFX &amp; make-up to other splatter thrillers such as _Maniac (1980)_ (qv), _The Burning (1981)_ (qv), _Creepshow (1982)_ (qv) and Romero&apos;s third &quot;Dead&quot; film, _Day of the Dead (1985)_ (qv) (for which he won a Saturn Award).  In 1990, Savini directed his feature film debut _Night of the Living Dead (1990)_ (qv), the remake of the original zombie-classic. Not content with just being behind the lens, however, Savini has appeared in dozens of films, and can be seen demonstrating his capable acting skills as &quot;Morgan, the Black Knight&quot; in _Knightriders (1981)_ (qv), as &quot;Blades&quot;, one of the biker gang members in _Dawn of the Dead (1978)_ (qv) and as &quot;Sex Machine&quot;, another leather-clad biker--but this time with a groin-mounted gun--in the wild vampire film _From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)_ (qv).</biography>

      <akaNames class="linked-list"/>
      <gender>FEMALE</gender>
      <birthDateAsString>10 March 1978</birthDateAsString>
      <biography>Originally from a tourist town in Canada, Cardinal was shuffled around until she ended up in foster care. At 12 years old, she co-founded a peer counseling organization dedicated to assisting children suffering from sexual abuse. By 16 she&apos;d decided to move to the US to live the American dream, working 3 jobs to make ends meet. At 19, misdiagnosed with cancer and only holding a grade 7 education, she turned her life around, went back to school and earned a bachelor&apos;s degree in Psychology on full scholarship. A natural leader, she was unanimously elected president of the theatre club and held that position until she graduated. It was then she knew the movie business was the only place for her. Still in school and working a full time corporate job, she booked the female lead in the Warner Brother&apos;s slasher flick &quot;Delivery&quot;. Soon, other offers came in. While juggling a budding film career, University and a full time job, she honed her improv skills at the Florida Renaissance Festival. Her first year performing as a man, because the festival director wouldn&apos;t let her sword fight as a woman.  A few films later, Cardinal combined the skills she&apos;d learned at her corporate job, her love of the Renaissance and sword play, and her name as an up and comer to create &quot;Legend of the Red Reaper&quot;. Seasoned pros and aspirings alike flocked to her side and the project took on a life of its own. No sooner was production underway than adversity came with it. Midway through filming, a co-production company embezzled 40% of the production funds - but Tara used her credit, her savings, and finally her own home to make up the difference. But it wasn&apos;t enough, and all of her above the line crew quit when the money ran out. Cardinal taught herself screen writing, submitted her body to a 4 month invasive medical study and became a professional wrestler to raise the money to finish the shoot. With no other producers on set, she promoted all of her department heads to producer and went on to direct and produce, while staring in the film. Her cast and crew stood by her side and the film was finished within months. Post production offered a new set of challenges. Over 120 minutes of footage was lost by a shady post house. Three editors failed to complete so much as a rough cut. One distribution company tried to extort the film from Cardinal, trying to use her hard won film as b-roll and putting Steven Segal in the lead. Cardinal held her ground and her movie, even when the big shots threatened to sue.  Finally, she caught the attention of movie mogul Uwe Boll, who took one look at the assembly her third editor compiled - and unfortunately passed.  Resolute, she made him a deal. If she edited a new cut, would he reconsider? He would and she did. But first, she had to learn how to edit. When Uwe Boll saw her cut, he decided on the spot to not only rep the movie, but to throw his full weight behind the project, bringing on an award winning post production team. Helmed by Cardinal, the movie was recut, colored and scored to reflect a new vision. As Cardinal evolved, so did the film. Cardinal polished the film with a personal narration, bringing the final product together as one cohesive unit.  In the midst of finishing Red Reaper, another project fell into her lap. Half finished, with 9 of 19 reels destroyed in a freak Fed-Ex accident, Cardinal put her skills to work, re-writing, re-casting, and re-shooting &quot;Scarlet Samurai&quot; (which originally went by the title &quot;Terminal Descent&quot;). Cardinal based the lead character on her martial arts master Sean Wyn, who trained her in both the physical and spiritual martial arts, creating a part Asian, part Jewish (lesbian) superhero infused with powers by her training in Buddhism. Cardinal not only stars as the samurai in training, but plays her own twin. She also co-edited both sound and picture, audio-mixed, color graded and did some of the visual effects.  In addition to creating two feature films, Cardinal also co-authored a novel based on the Red Reaper characters with fantasy novelist Alex Bledsoe. She is in talks to do a short run comic series for both properties and released an ashcan version of Red Reaper, featuring the art of George Perez at San Diego Comicon. She continues to accept roles in movies of all genres and her spare time gathers her celebrity friends for charity events at Dark Delicacies in Burbank. Since moving to Hollywood, California she has raised over $10,000 for charity to relieve the Tsunami victims in Japan, the earthquake victims in Haiti and Chile, Homeless youth and abandoned dogs in Los Angeles.  She currently resides in Hollywood California where she is catching up on some much needed sleep in between producing charity events, writing novels and comic books, and creating superheros.</biography>

      <birthName>Jones, Catherine</birthName>
      <biography>Catherine Zeta-Jones was born on September 25, 1969 in Swansea, West Glamorgan, Wales, UK, the daughter of Dai Jones, who formerly owned a candy factory, and Pat Jones. Her brother David Jones (b. 1967) is a development executive and brother Lyndon Jones (b. 1972) works at her production company. Catherine showed an interest early on in entertainment. She starred on stage in &quot;Annie&quot;, &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; and &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;. At age 15, she had the lead in the British revival of &quot;42nd Street&quot;. She was originally cast as the second understudy for the lead role in the musical but when the star and first understudy became sick the night the play&apos;s producer was in the audience, she was given the lead for the rest of the musical&apos;s production. She first made a name for herself in the early 1990s when she starred in the Yorkshire Television comedy/drama series _&quot;The Darling Buds of May&quot; (1991)_ (qv). The series was a smash hit and made her one of the United Kingdom&apos;s most popular television actresses. She subsequently played supporting roles in several films including _Christopher Columbus: The Discovery (1992)_ (qv), the miniseries _Catherine the Great (1996) (TV)_ (qv) and a larger part as the seductive Sala in _The Phantom (1996)_ (qv) before landing her breakthrough role playing the fiery Elena opposite &apos;Anthony Hopkins (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Antonio Banderas&apos; (qv) in _The Mask of Zorro (1998)_ (qv). She starred in many big-budget blockbusters like _Entrapment (1999)_ (qv), _The Haunting (1999)_ (qv) and _Traffic (2000)_ (qv), for which many believed she was robbed of an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress. In November 2000, she married actor &apos;Michael Douglas (I)&apos; (qv). She gave birth to their son Dylan Michael in August 2000 followed by daughter, Carys, in April 2003. She was awarded Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2010 Queen&apos;s Birthday Honours List for her accomplishments in film and television.</biography>

While in New York, Christoph met his first wife, and moved back to Vienna, then to London.  During the 80s, Christoph worked primarily in theater, commuting from his home in London to Germany. Slowly he began to work in TV, taking one-off roles on series, and TV movies. Film roles soon followed, however, attempts to break into English-speaking film and TV were unsuccessful.

      <biography>Matt Kohler is an American actor, producer, writer and director. He has starred in several film and television productions including _&quot;Hart of Dixie&quot; (2011)_ (qv), _&quot;Betty White&apos;s Off Their Rockers&quot; (2012)_ (qv) and _&quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; (2003)_ (qv).

Prior to his acting career he earned a Bachelor&apos;s Degree in Kinesiology and a Masters of Business Administration (MBA). During this time he modeled as a fashion, commercial, and fitness model. Most notably working with photographer &apos;Mario Testino&apos; (qv) for VMan magazine.  Matt began his acting career with the desire to move, inspire and entertain others through his work. He studied acting rigorously, including four years of training with renowned acting teacher &apos;Aaron Speiser&apos; (qv), coach for &apos;Will Smith (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Gerard Butler&apos; (qv), ultimately working in his esteemed Master Class.  In 2012, he launched his own production company, Silver Hero Entertainment, and is producing and developing several projects. His first was a live-action trailer _Captain Planet (2012)_ (qv) in which he played Captain Planet and Captain Pollution. The trailer went viral, being featured and reviewed on over 100 websites, Entertainment Weekly stated &quot;Given the choice between a studio remake and this quasi-gritty indie take, I&apos;d go with the latter.&quot; Sony Pictures took notice of the trailer and is developing a _Captain Planet (????)_ (qv) feature length film.  Kohler wrote, directed, produced and starred in an award-winning short film titled _Typecast (2014/I)_ (qv). He plays Blake, an actor that strives to break free of his &quot;type&quot; to play more interesting roles that move and inspire others. _Typecast (2014/I)_ (qv) is a short film (approx. 26 min) that won &quot;Best of Drama&quot; at the 2014 Wildwood Film Festival. It also has been selected into the 2014 New York International Independent Film Festival and the 2014 Toronto International Film Awards. Although it takes place in the entertainment industry, many will relate to the subject matter and overall message of the film. Matt was inspired to write the script after he saw &apos;Vin Diesel&apos; (qv)&apos;s short film _Multi-Facial (1995)_ (qv).  Matt will produce and star in the feature film titled _Stripped (2015)_ (qv). Stripping to settle her late father&apos;s debt, a young woman tries to balance her feelings for the head bouncer of the strip club, who devises a plan to rob the club on its busiest and most profitable night. Matt will play Mike &quot;Sep&quot; Sepowitz, the ex-football star turned head bouncer of the club. _Stripped (2015)_ (qv) is a highly stylized neo-noir crime thriller in the narrative vein of _The Town (2010)_ (qv) and visually similar to _Drive (2011/I)_ (qv).  His production company, Silver Hero Entertainment, has been hired to produce the feature film titled _Social Norm (2015)_ (qv). A coming of age comedy that deals with the current twenty-something dilemma of career and relationships. Matt will also star as Morgan, the successful business owner of a financial firm.  His latest project announced is titled _Gold (2015)_ (qv), a sports drama that centers around freestyle wrestling leading to the 2016 Summer Olympics. The film deals with the recent announcement that both greco-roman wrestling and freestyle wrestling will no longer be competing sports at the Olympic Games after 2016. There has been much controversy with the announcement as wrestling as been included since the Ancient Olympic Games. Kohler wrote the script and also plans on starring in the film. After the death of his younger brother, an aging freestyle wrestler begins an impossible task to bring home gold in his place.</biography>

      <birthName>Willis, Walter Bruce</birthName>
      <biography>Actor and musician Bruce Willis is well known for his film appearances as wisecracking or hard-edged characters, often in spectacular action films. Collectively, he has appeared in films that have grossed in excess of $2.5 billion USD placing him in the top ten stars in terms of box office receipts. Walter Bruce Willis was born on March 19, 1955, in West Germany, to an American father and a German mother, who were living on a United States military base. He was raised in Penns Grove, New Jersey. Willis picked up an interest for the dramatic arts in high school, and was allegedly &quot;discovered&quot; whilst working in a café in New York City and then appeared in a couple of off-Broadway productions. While bartending one night, he was seen by a casting director who liked his personality and needed a bartender for a small movie role.  After countless auditions, Willis contributed minor film appearances, usually uncredited, before landing the role of private eye &quot;David Addison&quot; alongside sultry &apos;Cybill Shepherd&apos; (qv) in the hit romantic comedy television series _&quot;Moonlighting&quot; (1985)_ (qv). The series firmly established Bruce Willis as a hot new talent, and his sarcastic and wisecracking P.I. was in effect a dry run for the role of hard-boiled NYC detective &quot;John McClane&quot; in the monster hit _Die Hard (1988)_ (qv). This superbly paced action film balanced laconic humor and wholesale destruction as Willis&apos; character single handedly battles a gang of ruthless international thieves in a Los Angeles skyscraper. Willis reprized the role of tough guy cop &quot;John McClane&quot; in the eagerly anticipated sequel _Die Hard 2 (1990)_ (qv) set at snowbound Washington&apos;s Dulles International Airport as a group of renegade Special Forces soldiers seek to repatriate a corrupt South American general. Excellent box office returns demanded a further sequel _Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995)_ (qv) this time also starring &apos;Samuel L. Jackson&apos; (qv) as a cynical Harlem shopowner unwittingly thrust into assisting McClane during a terrorist bombing campaign on a sweltering day in NYC.  Willis found time out from all the action mayhem to provide the voice of &quot;Mikey&quot; the baby in the very popular family comedies _Look Who&apos;s Talking (1989)_ (qv), and its sequel _Look Who&apos;s Talking Too (1990)_ (qv) also starring &apos;John Travolta (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Kirstie Alley&apos; (qv). Over the next decade, Willis starred in some very successful films, some very offbeat films and some unfortunate box office flops. _The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)_ (qv) and _Hudson Hawk (1991)_ (qv) were both large scale financial disasters that were savaged by the critics, and both are arguably best left off the CVs of all the actors involved, however Willis was still popular with movie audiences and selling plenty of theatre tickets with the hyperviolent _The Last Boy Scout (1991)_ (qv), the darkly humored _Death Becomes Her (1992)_ (qv) and the mediocre police thriller _Striking Distance (1993)_ (qv). During the 1990s, Willis also appeared in several independent and low budget productions that won him new fans and praise from the critics for his intriguing performances working with some very diverse film directors. He appeared in the oddly appealing _North (1994)_ (qv), as a cagey prizefighter in the &apos;Quentin Tarantino&apos; (qv) directed mega-hit _Pulp Fiction (1994)_ (qv), the &apos;Terry Gilliam&apos; (qv) directed apocalyptic thriller _Twelve Monkeys (1995)_ (qv), the &apos;Luc Besson&apos; (qv) directed sci-fi opus _The Fifth Element (1997)_ (qv) and the &apos;M. Night Shyamalan&apos; (qv) directed spine-tingling epic _The Sixth Sense (1999)_ (qv).  Willis next starred in the gangster comedy _The Whole Nine Yards (2000)_ (qv), worked again with &quot;hot&quot; director &apos;M. Night Shyamalan&apos; (qv) in the less gripping _Unbreakable (2000)_ (qv), and in two military dramas, _Hart&apos;s War (2002)_ (qv) and _Tears of the Sun (2003)_ (qv) that both failed to really fire with movie audiences or critics alike. However, Willis bounced back into the spotlight in the critically applauded &apos;Frank Miller (II)&apos; (qv) graphic novel turned movie _Sin City (2005)_ (qv), the voice of &quot;RJ&quot; the scheming raccoon in the animated hit _Over the Hedge (2006)_ (qv) and &quot;Die Hard&quot; fans rejoiced to see &quot;John McClane&quot; return to the big screen in the high tech _Live Free or Die Hard (2007)_ (qv) aka &quot;Die Hard 4.0&quot;.  Willis was married to actress &apos;Demi Moore&apos; (qv) for approximately thirteen years and they share custody to their three children.</biography>

      <birthName>Tamblyn, Russell Irving</birthName>
      <biography>Russ Tamblyn might as well face it...he will be a Jet &quot;till his last dying day.&quot; Indelibly linked to the &quot;womb to tomb&quot; role of Riff, the knife-wielding, rocket-tempered, Baryshnikov-styled gang leader of the streetwise Jets in the musical film masterpiece _West Side Story (1961)_ (qv), it&apos;s not a bad way to be remembered! Russ was actually 27 when he portrayed the teenage troublemaker who became the &apos;50s equivalent of the Mercutio character in the Romeo and Juliet-inspired adaptation.  To describe Tamblyn as talented and extremely agile is a huge understatement. This awesome musical performer was born in Los Angeles, California on December 30, 1934, and groomed early for stardom. Discovered at age ten by actor &apos;Lloyd Bridges (I)&apos; (qv) for the play &quot;Stone Jungle&quot;, Russ was soon performing on radio and in L.A.-based musical revues. Billed as &quot;Rusty Tamblyn&quot; then, the tousle-haired scrapper played a student extra in his first film _The Boy with Green Hair (1948)_ (qv) starring another child actor, &apos;Dean Stockwell&apos; (qv). Having taken up dancing and acrobatics from the age of 6, Tamblyn marked his abilities with his very first TV appearance on the &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show.&quot; Eventually handed a starring role in the &quot;B&quot; film _The Kid from Cleveland (1949)_ (qv), he was signed by an eager MGM who saw his potential as a juvenile actor. Featured in the popular family-oriented comedy _Father of the Bride (1950)_ (qv), and its sequel _Father&apos;s Little Dividend (1951)_ (qv), Tamblyn also had a prime role in the war drama _Take the High Ground! (1953)_ (qv) before taking off in musical films. Demonstrating exceptional athleticism in one of MGM&apos;s best, _Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954)_ (qv), Tamblyn&apos;s timing was regrettably off as musicals were quickly on the wane. He adjusted, however. A starring role in the low-budget _The Young Guns (1956)_ (qv) led to excellent reviews in the ensemble box-office soaper _Peyton Place (1957)_ (qv). Tamblyn, along with &apos;Lana Turner&apos; (qv), &apos;Arthur Kennedy (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Hope Lange&apos; (qv) and &apos;Diane Varsi&apos; (qv), all received Oscar nominations for their participation. Russ scored quite well in the title role of _tom thumb (1958)_ (qv), which became a large stepping stone in his being cast as Riff in 1961. Following this achievement, however, the offers started dwindling.  Tamblyn&apos;s last co-starring roles in quality films were shot overseas with the British-produced chiller _The Haunting (1963)_ (qv) with &apos;Julie Harris (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Claire Bloom (I)&apos; (qv), and the British-Yugoslavian Viking costumer _The Long Ships (1964)_ (qv) starring &apos;Richard Widmark&apos; (qv) and &apos;Sidney Poitier&apos; (qv). After that, his career grew quite dismal. Titles such as _The Female Bunch (1971)_ (qv), _Satan&apos;s Sadists (1969)_ (qv), _Scream Free! (1969)_ (qv), _Dracula vs. Frankenstein (1971)_ (qv) and _Blood Screams (1990)_ (qv) pretty much tells the story. On the road in the lean years with minor stage productions here and there, including the musical &quot;Cabaret,&quot; Russ all but disappeared from the viewing audience. When he finally nabbed the role of the overtly weird (and who wasn&apos;t on that show?) psychiatrist Dr. Lawrence Jacoby in the popular TV cult series _&quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990)_ (qv), it was the first time Tamblyn had generated interest in over two decades. Barely recognizable with his wild-eyed look, mangy hair and frizzy beard, he has since gained employment off this eccentric image. Married three times, Tamblyn has lately taken on choreographic duties and the managing of actress/daughter &apos;Amber Tamblyn&apos; (qv)&apos;s career, she of _&quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot; (2003)_ (qv) fame.</biography>

      <birthName>Purcell, Robert Douglas</birthName>
      <biography>Robert Douglas Purcell grew up in the small town of Scituate, which is located on the south shore of Massachusetts. He had a talent for art in school, graduated early from Scituate High School&apos;s Class of 1976 and joined the Marines. He has lived in California since 1982, was married in 1985 and divorced in 2003. He has two beautiful daughters.  Purcell has worked steadily in film, television and commercials. Stage credits include performances as &quot;Major Roberts&quot; in Layon Gray&apos;s acclaimed WWII play, Black Angels Over Tuskegee (2009), &quot;Murray&quot; in the New Voices/OC Playwrights Alliance production of Christmas In Pakistan (2007), &quot;Bobby&quot; in the Dillstar West production of The Soprano&apos;s Last Supper, and &quot;Petruchio&quot; in the Newport Beach Repertory production of The Haunting of Will Shakespeare. Although often cast as the authority figure, such as the &quot;Police Officer&quot; in the short film, The Silent (2006), the villainous Army General &quot;Agamemnon&quot; in the award winning short, Cassandra (2006) or the &quot;Slot Machine Pit Boss&quot; opposite Al Pacino in Ocean&apos;s Thirteen (2007), Purcell lists some of the more off-beat characters he has played as personal favorites. They include the down and out ex-boxer, ex-mafia tough guy &quot;Joe&quot; in the faith-based feature film, Faith Happens (2005) and the gay &quot;Bartender&quot; in the feature film, Hollywood, Je T&apos;aime (2009).  Purcell can be seen as the Angels Pitching Coach, the Umpire and annoying Sports Writer in several television commercials for Howard&apos;s TV &amp; Appliances, featuring Angels manager, Mike Scioscia and 2nd baseman, Howie Kendrick. His voice (as various characters) can be heard in several humorous Howard&apos;s TV &quot;Halo Hotline&quot; radio spots during the L.A. Angels of Anaheim &apos;07-&apos;09 baseball seasons.</biography>

      <biography>Proclaimed by many critics as one of the best young actors of his generation, Ben Whishaw was born in Clifton, Bedfordshire, where he grew up along with his twin brother James. Ben attended Samuel Whitbread Community College where his interest in theatre grew and he became a member of the Bancroft Players Youth Theatre at Hitchin&apos;s Queen Mother Theatre. During his time there he rose to prominence in many productions, most notably If This Is a Man, based on the book of the same name by &apos;Primo Levi&apos; (qv), a survivor of Nazi World War II prisoner of war camp. The play was taken to the Edinburgh Festival in 1995 where it garnered five-star reviews and great critical acclaim with Ben Whishaw getting rave reviews for his portrayal of Levi. Ben then enrolled in, RADA from where he graduated in 2004 and soon landed the role of Hamlet in &apos;Trevor Nunn&apos; (qv)&apos;s 2004 production making him one of the youngest actors to portray Hamlet on-stage. Hamlet opened to rave reviews with many critics hailing Ben as the next &apos;Laurence Olivier&apos; (qv) and applauding his portrayal of Hamlet with leading critics haling the birth of a star. Whishaw&apos;s film and TV credits include _Layer Cake (2004)_ (qv) and &apos;Christopher Morris (I)&apos; (qv)&apos; 2005 sitcom _&quot;Nathan Barley&quot; (2005)_ (qv), in which he played a character called Pingu. He was named &quot;Most Promising Newcomer&quot; at the 2001 British Independent Film Awards (for _My Brother Tom (2001)_ (qv)) and, in 2005, nominated as best actor in four award ceremonies for his Hamlet. He also played &apos;Keith Richards (II)&apos; (qv) in the &apos;Stephen Woolley&apos; (qv) biopic _Stoned (2005)_ (qv). Whishaw played in _Perfume: The Story of a Murderer (2006)_ (qv) as Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, a perfume maker whose craft turns deadly getting raves once again for his stunning portrayal. Whishaw appeared in 2007&apos;s _I&apos;m Not There (9999)_ as one of the &apos;Bob Dylan&apos; (qv) reincarnations and in 2008 in _&quot;Criminal Justice&quot; (2008)_ (qv) a TV series. He appears in the forthcoming films _The Tempest (2010/I)_ (qv) and _Bright Star (2009)_ (qv).</biography>

      <biography>Born as Yang Zi Chong in the mining town of Ipoh in West Malaysia in the lunar year of the Tiger, she spoke English and Malay before Chinese. A ballet dancer since age 4, she moved to London, England to study at the Royal Academy as a teenager. After a brief dance career, she won the Miss Malaysia beauty pageant title in her native country and the Miss Moomba beauty pageant title in Melbourne, Australia in the early 1980s. Her first on camera work was a 1984 commercial with martial arts star &apos;Jackie Chan (I)&apos; (qv). In 1985, she began making action movies with D&amp;B Films of Hong Kong. She was first billed as Michelle Khan, then later, Michelle Yeoh. Never a trained martial artist, she relied on her dance discipline and her on-set trainers to prepare for her martial arts action scenes.  She uses many dance moves in her films. She still does most of her own stunts and has been injured many times. Ironically, she still cannot read Chinese and she has to have Chinese script read to her. In 1988, she married wealthy D&amp;B Films executive &apos;Dickson Poon&apos; (qv) and retired from acting. Even though they divorced in 1992, she is close to Poon&apos;s second wife and a godmother to Poon&apos;s daughter. When she returned to acting, she became very popular to Chinese audiences and she became known to western audiences through her co-starring roles in the James Bond film _Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)_ (qv) and in the phenomenally successful _Wo hu cang long (2000)_ (qv) aka Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&apos; directed by &apos;Ang Lee&apos; (qv). She turned down a role in a sequel to _The Matrix (1999)_ (qv).  She has her own production company, Mythical Films and has trained with the Shen Yang Acrobatic team for her role in _Tian mai zhuan qi (2002)_ (qv), an English language film she is both starring in and producing. She hopes to use her company to discover and nurture new filmmaking talent. She also wants to act in roles that combine both action and deeper spiritual themes.</biography>

      <biography>In January of 1992, _Reservoir Dogs (1992)_ (qv) appeared at the Sundance Film Festival, by first-time writer-director Quentin Tarantino. The film garnered critical acclaim and the director became a legend immediately. Two years later, he followed up Dogs success with _Pulp Fiction (1994)_ (qv) which premiered at the Cannes film festival, winning the coveted Palme D&apos;Or Award. At the 1995 Academy Awards, it was nominated for the best picture, best director and best original screenplay. Tarantino and writing partner &apos;Roger Avary&apos; (qv) came away with the award only for best original screenplay. In 1995, Tarantino directed one fourth of the anthology _Four Rooms (1995)_ (qv) with friends and fellow auteurs &apos;Alexandre Rockwell&apos; (qv), &apos;Robert Rodriguez (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Allison Anders&apos; (qv). The film opened on December 25th in the United States to very weak reviews. Tarantino&apos;s next film was _From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)_ (qv), a vampire/crime story which he wrote and co-starred with &apos;George Clooney&apos; (qv). The film did fairly well theatrically.</biography>

      <birthName>Green, Eva Gaëlle</birthName>
      <biography>Eva Gaëlle Green was born on July 5, 1980, in Paris, France. She has a non-identical twin sister. Her father, Walter Green, is a dentist who appeared in the 1966 film _Au hasard Balthazar (1966)_ (qv). Her mother, &apos;Marlène Jobert&apos; (qv), is an actress who retired from acting and became a writer of children&apos;s books. Eva&apos;s mother was born in Algeria, of Sephardi Jewish heritage (during that time, Algeria was part of France), and Eva&apos;s father is of Swedish and French descent. Eva left French school at 17. She switched to English in Ramsgate, Kent, and went to the American School in France for one year. She studied acting at Saint Paul Drama School in Paris for three years, then had a 10-week polishing course at the Weber Douglas Academy of dramatic Art in London. She also studied directing at the Tisch School of Arts at New York University.  She returned to Paris as an accomplished young actress, and played on stage in several theater productions: &quot;La Jalousie en Trois Fax&quot; and &quot;Turcaret&quot;. There she caught the eye of director &apos;Bernardo Bertolucci&apos; (qv). Green followed a recommendation to work on her English. She studied for two months with an English coach before doing _The Dreamers (2003)_ (qv) with &apos;Bernardo Bertolucci&apos; (qv). During their work Bertolucci described Green as being &quot;so beautiful it&apos;s indecent.&quot; Green won critical acclaim for her role in _The Dreamers (2003)_ (qv). She also attracted a great deal of attention from male audiences for her full frontal nudity in several scenes of the film. Besides her work as an actress Green also composed original music and recorded several sound tracks for the film score.  After The Dreamers Green&apos;s career ascended to the level where she revealed more of her multifaceted acting talent. She played the love interest of cult French gentleman stealer _Arsène Lupin (2004)_ (qv) opposite &apos;Romain Duris&apos; (qv). In 2005 she co-starred opposite &apos;Orlando Bloom&apos; (qv) and &apos;Liam Neeson&apos; (qv) in _Kingdom of Heaven (2005)_ (qv) produced and directed by &apos;Ridley Scott&apos; (qv). The film brought her a wider international exposure. She turned down the femme fatale role in The Black Dahlia that went to &apos;Hilary Swank&apos; (qv) because she didn&apos;t want to end up always typecast as a femme fatale after her role in The Dreamers. Instead, Eva Green accepted the prestigious role of Vesper Lynd, one of three Bond girls, opposite &apos;Daniel Craig (I)&apos; (qv) in _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv) and became the 5th French actress to play a James Bond girl after &apos;Claudine Auger&apos; (qv) in _Thunderball (1965)_ (qv), &apos;Corinne Cléry (I)&apos; (qv) in _Moonraker (1979)_ (qv), &apos;Carole Bouquet&apos; (qv) in _For Your Eyes Only (1981)_ (qv) and &apos;Sophie Marceau&apos; (qv) in The World is not enough (1999).  Since her school years Green has been a cosmopolitan multilingual and multicultural person. Yet, since her father always lived in France with them and her mother, she and her twin sister can&apos;t speak Swedish. She developed a wide scope of interests beyond her acting profession and became an aspiring art connoisseur and an avid museum visitor. Her other activities outside of acting include playing and composing music, cooking at home, walking her terrier, and collecting art. She shares time between her two residencies, one is in Paris, France, and one in London, England.</biography>

      <birthName>Gill, Jimmy Lee</birthName>
      <biography>His legal name is Jimmy Lee Gill. His professional name is Seth Bailey. He has been a performing clown almost his entire life.  Early 1950&apos;s, as a pre-school child Jimmy&apos;s Grandfather, the former world renowned circus clown Seth Walter Bailey also and better known as &quot;Bill Bailey&quot; would make-up and costumed Jimmy as a clown then take the miniature clown along on gigs.  Late 1960&apos;s, Jimmy began his professional career at the age of 16 with summer employment at the Memphis Zoological Garden as a clown for its daily one-ring circus. Tommy O&apos;Brian, the former world renowned circus animal trainer, directed this two-shows-a-day gig. Jimmy used Grandpa Bailey&apos;s make-up kit and costume. He did a bald Whiteface 2-piece clown suit and tie entity.  Early 1970&apos;s, Jimmy became a member of the Al Chymia Shriners&apos; Clown Unit in Memphis, Tennessee. He continued to use Grandpa Bailey&apos;s make-up kit and costume. He did a red mop wigged Whiteface ragged Andy type entity. All of the Clown Unit&apos;s gigs were for charitable causes. One May they dressed for 20 events. One Memorial Day weekend, they raised over $6,500 for the &quot;Muscular Dystrophy Association&apos;s Telethon&quot; by collecting change from passing motorists at a major Memphis street intersection.  Late 1980&apos;s, Jimmy became a member of the Woodland Hills Shriners&apos; Clown Club in Los Angeles, California. He now had his own much larger make-up kit and a couple of his own costumes. He introduced two new personal clown entities: Hobo 01 and Auguste 04. All of this Clown Club&apos;s gigs were for charitable causes. They regularly visited nursing homes to entertained seniors. They also dressed for as many holiday parades as possible and children&apos;s causes such as the &quot;Juvenile Diabetes Foundation&quot;.  Early 1990&apos;s, Jimmy co-founded and became a charter member of the Al Malaikah Shriners&apos; Clown Unit in Los Angeles, California. He continued doing Hobo 01 and Auguste 04 while developing three new personal clown entities: Tramp 02, Auguste 03 and Whiteface 05. All of the Clown Unit&apos;s gigs were for charitable causes including weekly visited the Shriners&apos; Hospital for Children.  Mid 1990&apos;s, responding to numerous requests, Jimmy began to voluntarily teach clowning skills to non-profit groups: churches, community recreational centers, fraternities, etc. During this endeavor, he had the pleasure of creating an unknown number of clown entities for others of all ages, children to seniors. Each of these clown troops furthered local charities as their purpose.  Late 1997, One of Jimmy&apos;s former clown students, AEA/AFTRA/AGVA/SAG member &apos;Sherri McKenzie&apos; (qv), recommended him to a Casting Director for a role as a clown in the feature film remake titled _Carnival of Souls (1998)_ (qv). He was booked and worked that project as Hobo 01. He found this new creative outlet quite thrilling, desired more of it and pursued it with new found passion.  Early 1998, Jimmy became a member of AFTRA and SAG. Since then, he&apos;s worked under the jurisdiction of both unions on being called. He continued to do Hobo 01, Tramp 02, Auguste 03, Auguste 04 and Whiteface 05 while developing four new personal clown entities: Whiteface 06, Mime 07, Character 08 and Character 09. Jimmy now adopted the professional name of Seth Bailey to honor Grandpa Bailey, from whence his roots grow. By virtue of his work Jimmy&apos;s earned eligibility to join AEA.  Late 1998, Jimmy was asked if he could duplicate John Wayne Gacy&apos;s &quot;Pogo the Clown&quot; entity for the feature television film titled _Men in White (1998) (TV)_ (qv). An Internet search provided a color image of Gacy&apos;s sinister clown entity which Jimmy did duplicate as requested.  Early 2000, Jimmy volunteered to help the &quot;Make-A-Wish Foundation of Greater Los Angeles&quot; grant a terminally ill young boy&apos;s wish of having a clown host his birthday party. Jimmy worked the party of family and friends as Auguste 03 with: balloon sculptures, comedic stich, face painting, juggling, and magic (both stage and close-up). Efern&apos;s face beamed joy and his excitement was contagious! This sadly, turned out to be Efern&apos;s last birthday as he succumbed to leukemia. Jimmy&apos;s still on-call for Make-A-Wish.  Mid 2000, Jimmy&apos;s voluntarily worked several fund-raisers for the &quot;Starlight Children&apos;s Foundation&quot;. Jimmy&apos;s also still on-call for Starlight.  Jimmy continues working gigs for charitable causes, AFTRA and SAG. He now additionally offers his services for corporate events, i.e. a specially designed iconic entity, spokesman, grand openings, annual parties, etc. He has worked one Hollywood Studio Producer&apos;s Christmas Party as Mime 07. He is a professional clown in both appearance and entertainment quality.</biography>

      <birthName>Butler, Gerard James</birthName>
      <biography>Born in Paisley, Scotland, to Margaret and Edward Butler, Gerard Butler was raised, along with his older brother and sister, in his hometown of Paisley, Scotland. He also spent some of his youth in Canada. His parents divorced when he was a child, and he and his siblings were raised primarily by their mother, who later remarried. He had no contact with his father between the ages of two and 16 years old, after which time they became close. His father passed away when Gerard was in his early 20s. Butler went on to attend Glasgow University, where he studied to be a lawyer/solicitor. He was president of the school&apos;s law society thanks to his outgoing personality and great social skills.  His acting career began when he was approached in a London coffee shop by actor &apos;Steven Berkoff (I)&apos; (qv), who later appeared alongside Butler in _Attila (2001/I) (TV)_ (qv), who gave him a role in a stage production of &quot;Coriolanus&quot;. After that, Butler decided to give up law for acting. He was cast as &apos;Ewan McGregor&apos; (qv)&apos;s character &quot;Renton&quot; in the stage adaptation of [i]Trainspotting[/i]. His film debut was as &apos;Billy Connolly (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s younger brother in _Mrs Brown (1997)_ (qv). While filming the movie in Scotland, he was enjoying a picnic with his mother near the River Tay when they heard the shouts of a young boy, who had been swimming with a friend, who was in some trouble. Butler jumped in and saved the young boy from drowning. He received a Certificate of Bravery from the Royal Humane Society. He felt he only did what anyone in the situation would have done.  His film career continued with small roles, first in the &quot;James Bond&quot; movie, _Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)_ (qv), and then &apos;Russell Mulcahy&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Tale of the Mummy (1998)_ (qv). In 2000, Butler was cast in two breakthrough roles, the first being &quot;Attila the Hun&quot; in the USA Network mini-series, _Attila (2001/I) (TV)_ (qv). The film&apos;s producers wanted a known actor to play the part but kept coming back to Butler&apos;s screen tests and decided he was their man. He had to lose the thick Scottish accent, but managed well. Around the time &quot;Attila&quot; was being filmed, casting was in progress for &apos;Wes Craven&apos; (qv)&apos;s new take on the &quot;Dracula&quot; legacy. Also wanting a known name, Butler wasn&apos;t much of a consideration, but his unending tenacity drove him to hounding the producers. Eventually, he sent them a clip of his portrayal of &quot;Attila&quot;. Evidently, they saw something because _Dracula 2000 (2000)_ (qv) was cast in the form of Butler. Attila&apos;s producers, thinking that his big-screen role might help with their own film&apos;s ratings, finished shooting a little early so he could get to work on _Dracula 2000 (2000)_ (qv). Following these two roles, Butler developed quite a fan base, an Internet site and began appearing on lists everywhere.  Since then, he has appeared in _Reign of Fire (2002)_ (qv) as &quot;Creedy&quot; and _Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life (2003)_ (qv) as &quot;Terry Sheridan&quot;, alongside &apos;Angelina Jolie&apos; (qv). The role that garnered him the most attention from both moviegoers and movie makers, alike, was that of &quot;Andre Marek&quot; in the big-screen adaptation of &apos;Michael Crichton&apos; (qv)&apos;s novel, _Timeline (2003)_ (qv). Butler played an archaeologist who was sent back in time with a team of students to rescue a colleague. Last year, he appeared in &apos;Andrew Lloyd Webber&apos; (qv)&apos;s musical, _The Phantom of the Opera (2004)_ (qv), playing the title character in the successful adaptation of the stage musical. It was a role that brought him much international attention. Other projects include _Dear Frankie (2004)_ (qv), _The Game of Their Lives (2005)_ (qv) and _Beowulf &amp; Grendel (2005)_ (qv).  In 2007, he starred as Spartan &quot;King Leonidas&quot; in the Warner Bros. production _300 (2006)_ (qv), based on the &apos;Frank Miller (II)&apos; (qv) graphic novel, and _Butterfly on a Wheel (2007)_ (qv), co-starring &apos;Pierce Brosnan&apos; (qv) and &apos;Maria Bello&apos; (qv), which aired on network TV under the title, &quot;Shattered&quot;. He most recently starred in _P.S. I Love You (2007)_ (qv), with Academy Award-winner &apos;Hilary Swank&apos; (qv).  In 2007, he appeared in _Nim&apos;s Island (2008)_ (qv) and _RocknRolla (2008)_ (qv), and completed the new &apos;Mark Neveldine&apos; (qv) / &apos;Brian Taylor (V)&apos; (qv) film, _Gamer (2009)_ (qv). His next films included _The Ugly Truth (2009)_ (qv), co-starring &apos;Katherine Heigl&apos; (qv), which began filming in April 2008, _The Bounty Hunter (2010/I)_ (qv), _How to Train Your Dragon (2010)_ (qv), _Chasing Mavericks (2012)_ (qv) and _Olympus Has Fallen (2013)_ (qv). Butler is also a relative of rising animator and film director &apos;Mark Flood (III)&apos; (qv).</biography>

      <gender>MALE</gender>
      <biography>Takara was born the youngest of 2 in Washington, DC. She never had an interest in politics so she spent the majority of her adolescence a student athlete, with quixotic dreams of being an Olympic gymnast and lawyer.  Takara got her first taste of the stage as &quot;Orchid&quot; in her school&apos;s production of Rose Petal&apos;s Place at the age of 7. However, the idea of being an actor was not in her sights. In fact, she was shy and dreaded being in front of audiences and her &quot;gripping performance&quot; did not change her disposition.  It wasn&apos;t until she performed a short skit in her high school social studies class where she realized she was on to something. Immediately after that class, the instructor encouraged Takara to register for her Drama class the next semester. She spent the remainder of her time in high school exploring the arts and discovered she had a knack for the performing arts.  Spending less than a year in the work force, after graduating college, Takara decided she would move to Atlanta, GA to try to make it as an actress. Since her move she has been blazing a trail through Atlanta&apos;s arts community in Film, Television, and Theatre. Most recently, the City of Atlanta awarded Takara the Emerging Artist Award in Media Arts.  In addition to acting, Takara is hard at work developing her production company and producing a web series she wrote.</biography>
